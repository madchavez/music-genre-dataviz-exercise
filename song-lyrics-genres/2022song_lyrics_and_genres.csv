Sometimes, all I think about is you

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June

Siempre que encuentro tiempo, está bien (Sí)

Rezas por mis demonios, chica, te tengo
Cada vez que tomo codeína, me vuelvo vulnerable
Conozco los sonidos de la tormenta cuando llega
Ella entiendе que no puedo llevarla a todas partеs, un negro va
He estado en el campo como los hijos del maíz

Puedo escuchar tus lágrimas cuando caen por el teléfono
Enojate contigo mismo porque no puedes dejarme solo
Chismes, estás desordenado, eso no es lo que estamos haciendo
Atrapado alrededor del mundo (Preocupado por un Xanny, ¿te jactarías, o te haría tratar de conseguirme?)
Por teléfono, soltando lágrimas (Dime ahora, te necesito con mucho gusto)
Tuve que volverme más vulnerable de lo que acabo de hacer (Dime ahora, te necesito tanto, sí)
Cuando estás borracha, me dices exactamente cómo te sientes (Esperaré por ti, por ti)
Cuando estoy solo lo mantengo real (Esperaré por ti, esperaré por ti)
Por favor, dile a uno real exactamente lo qué es (Esperaré, esperaré, por ti, por tí)
No lo digas porque sabes que eso es lo que quiero escuchar (Esperaré por ti)
(Esperaré por ti)

Sí, he estado atrapado alrededor del mundo
Me siento en mi balcón y me pregunto cómo te sientes
Tengo una carrera que me quita el tiempo de las mujeres
No puedo convencerte de que te amo para vivir (Esperaré por ti, por ti)
Estaré en tu línea, los sentimientos fluyen como un río
Vuelve a enviar mensajes de texto, tú estás con tu Kiki en el río (Esperaré por ti)
Los mensajes dicen ""entregados"" (Esperaré por ti), pero sé que ustedes no lo entienden
¿Por qué nos lo presentas si sabías que estabas con él? (Esperaré por ti, por ti, por ti)

Sácame de la tabla porque sabes que soy nadador (Esperaré por ti)

Te estaba follando cuando tuviste una pequeña Presidencial
Mejoró cuando me conociste y eso no es coincidencia
Traté de sacar lo mejor de ti, pero supongo que no soy tan influyente
Supongo que no soy el indicado para ti

Puedo escuchar tus lágrimas cuando caen por el teléfono
Enojate contigo mismo porque no puedes dejarme solo
Chismes, estás desordenado, eso no es lo que estamos haciendo
Atrapado alrededor del mundo (Preocupado por un Xanny, ¿te jactarías, o te haría tratar de conseguirme?)
Por teléfono, soltando lágrimas (Dime ahora, te necesito con mucho gusto)
Tuve que volverme más vulnerable de lo que acabo de hacer (Dime ahora, te necesito tanto, sí)
Cuando estás borracha, me dices exactamente cómo te sientes (Esperaré por ti, por ti)
Cuando estoy solo lo mantengo real (Esperaré por ti, esperaré por ti)
Por favor, dile a uno real exactamente lo qué es (Esperaré, esperaré, por ti, por tí)
No lo digas porque sabes que eso es lo que quiero escuchar (Esperaré por ti)

Temprano en la mañana, tarde en la noche
Ni siquiera importa la hora que sea
Preocupado por un Xanny, ¿te jactarías, o te haría tratar de conseguirme?
Dime ahora, te necesito con mucho gusto

Pass auf dich auf

Ich wache auf zu den Klängen der Stille, die
Meinen Gedanken erlaubt, herumzuschweifen, mit meinem Ohr auf dem Boden
Ich suche, um die Geschichten zu sehen, die erzählt werden
Wenn ich der Welt meinen Rücken zugekehrt habe, die lächelte, als ich mich umdrehte

Sagеn dir, du seist der Größte
Abеr sobald du dich umdrehst, hassen sie uns

Oh, welch ein Jammer
Alle wollen mein Feind sein
Erspar dir das Mitleid
Alle wollen mein Feind-d-d-d-d sein
(Pass auf dich auf)
Mein Feind-d-d-d-d (Pass auf, pass auf, pass auf, pass auf)
(Pass auf dich auf)
Aber ich bin bereit

Deine Worte an der Wand, während du für meinen Niedergang betest
Und das Gelächter in den Hallen und die Beschimpfungen, die mir zugeworfen wurden
Ich sammle sie in meinem Kopf, und ich warte auf die Zeit
Wenn ich euch zeige, wie es ist, Worte zu sein, die in ein Mikrofon gespuckt werden

Sagen dir, du seist der Größte
Aber sobald du dich umdrehst, hassen sie uns (Ha)

Ich bete, dass jemand für mich hofft
Ich lebe, wo keiner h-h-hingeschickt werden sollte
Bin ein emotionales Wrack
Immer bereit zu gehen, sag einfach Bescheid
Der Weg ist lang, also drück das Pedal in den Boden
Der Feind auf meiner Spur, meine Energie nicht verfügbar
Ich werde denen „Hasta luego“ sagen
Sie wollen sich verschwören auf meinem Weg nach oben
Ich bin außer Form, sehe über den Tellerrand, ich bin ein Astronaut
Ich habe das Planetengestein gesprengt, um eine Katastrophe zu verursachen
Und es zählt mehr, weil ich es nicht getan hätte
Hätte ich daran gedacht, meinen Feinden
Schaden anzurichten, irgendwie schockierend, sie wollten Statik
Mit Präzision, ich bin automatisch Quarterback
Ich rede nicht übers Scheitern, pack's ein
Pack es ein, ich hab' keine Panik, schlage-schlage zu
Wer ist der Beste? Es ist egal, denn wir sind an deinem Hals

Alle wollen mein Feind sein

If I was your man, I'd upload a picture on Fridays and Mondays (So)

For the whole world to see how hot you are, you are

And I'm loose out on the streets, but I'd quit for you
I'll behave nicely if you ask me to (Ayy, ayy)

And finally find you

But in confidence she confesses to me

I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in L.A
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count

'Cause I just wanna see
If this could make me happy

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive

Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care

Sí, vida
La vida es lo único que necesitamos
Ellos necesitan que me vaya, pero yo no quiero irme
Descansa en paz Lil Keed

A la mierda un encasillamiento, soy un búho nocturno, este es un modo diferente
Y no es que no sea un buen momento para que te vayas a casa
Escuché que estás con un guardia, sólo deja que un negro lo sepa
Te tendría al lado de la cancha, no en la fila del medio
Todo está bien, amor, en un minuto, sin embargo
No puedo estresarme por ninguna perra porque soy un alma tímida
Además estoy cocinando la ambición en una estufa de cocina
La olla comienza a burbujear, ve la espuma, esa mierda es buena
Las putas dicen que soy suave, pero no puedo conseguir RICO'd
Él cree que es John Wayne, le compré piedras amarillas
Me encanta la forma en que cuelgan, nena, a la mierda la silicona
Todo el mundo es falso ahora, tu podrías descifrar el código
Todo lo que se rompe, se pone en oro rosa
Tengo miedo a hablar con estos negros como si fuera J. Cole
Puedo decir si su cabeza es buena antes de que lo sepa
Perra, no me digas que eres modelo si no has estado en Vogue
Tengo que hacer una fiesta para los que han estado desde el inicio
No están en el estudio, pero van a poner algo
Descansa en paz a Drama King, estábamos en lo más alto
¿No te gusta mi forma de hablar? Negro, di algo
Tengo que hacer una fiesta para los que han estado desde el principio
Muéstrate y sabes que somos nosotros, el bajo está saltando
¿No te gusta mi forma de hablar? Negro, di algo
Sal de mi vista, negro

No están en el estudio, pero van a poner algo

Gran caminador, vino en un Rolls, pero se fue en una camilla (21)
Dejo que mi hermano conduzca mientras yo disparo, trabajo en equipo (21)
Respondo todas estas preguntas, perra, debes pensar que eres Nadeska
El rifle gusta ser sentido en todos los enemigos, es un abusador (21)
Estaré con mi arma como Rozay con pimienta de limón
Ella quiere escuchar algunos Afrobeats porque acaba de explotar un Tesla
Todo ese trabajo fuera, ese negro debe pensar que es un luchador
Pero esto no es UFC, este rifle viene con un compresor (21)
Este rifle viene con un compresor (Cobarde)
Este rifle viene con un— (Cobarde)

Si estás de pie en el negocio, pon tu arma arriba (21, 21)
Viene actuando miedoso, toma tu mierda (21)
Me enamoré de sentirme mareado, así que estoy chiflado (21)
Tengo un loco amor por el chico, sí, ese es mi gemelo (21)
Si esos negros siguen insultando, me moveré de nuevo (21)
Somos la razón por lo que los enemigos no tienen amigozzz (21)
El último negro que jugó conmigo se volvió tonto
Ni siquiera lo rodé en el Wood porque está con moho
Si preguntas cómo está, solo le digo que venga y me folle
Le disparó veinte veces, maldita sea, este negro tiene suerte (Diablos, este negro tiene suerte)

I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs

Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two

Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker

I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter

Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus""?
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back, what breaks the camel's back? It's
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, woah
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, woah
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

Under the surface
I hide my nerves, and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin', but on and on it goes
But wait
If I could shake
The crushing weight
Of expectations, would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation?
Or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure
This growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going
'Cause all we know is
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, woah
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt, and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, woah
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks, no breaks
No mistakes, no pressure","USA, Disney, encanto cast, Soundtrack, Reggaeton"

Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance

Cheers, mami
Ah, ah, ah, ay

What doesn't help, don't let it get in the way
You made an own goal for being clumsy
The torque turned out to be too big for you
I'm not for you to fall in love with anymore, baby (Chi)
Without a Visa or passport
I sent your fake love on a vacation (Chi, chi, chi, chi, chi, chi)
Fuck off and don't come back
I hope you get everything you deserve, no
For what you did to me if you don't remember

Don't call me again, I threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes
Don't misunderstand me
Bеcause of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again (Chi)

I got to the party, takе the bottle out
The one that loved you, I don't know who she is
I left you a review, I didn't give you even one star
And I forgot you because you didn't leave footprints
I don't look back anymore, not even to park
I have one that's ready to take me
The second is waiting in the hotel
And the third, I'll meet him tonight (No, no)
Don't call me, 'cause I changed my number (Changed)
If you want me to give it you (Give)
Call 1-800-go fuck yourself
I don't know if you heard me
Don't call me, 'cause I changed my number (Changed)
If you want me to give it you (Give)

Don't call me again, I even threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes, ah-ah
Don't misunderstand me
Because of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again (Ayy)

Ay, I'm sorry (Ah)
You're desire to come back (Ayy) died in the attempt (Ah)
You made it look like you lost time
You came out well because I don't even count mine (Papi)
I see you on social media, I can't believe it, what a shame (What a shame)
I was good and you such trash paying me back like that (Wow, such trash)
Rat with two feet, Paquita said it
A creeping animal (Haha)
That eats everything he finds
Damn, you're a whore (Whore)
Don't say ""I adore you"", instead be honest (Ayy)
Don't say ""I love you"" (Ah) because that was in vain (Ah)
You were crying and since I didn't get with you
You're eating another, but you're thinking of me (Chi)

Don't call me again, I even threw out the phone

Salgo directamente del 6, y no perdonamos mariquitas

Follo con ella y follo con ella y ella
La golpeé, err, y le digo que haga el error, seguro

Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well","country, pop, female vocalists, singer-songwriter, acoustic"

And noticed she was fine, and noticed she was fine
She wants to grind and get high
I'll smack that ass
Whenever you want, ready for you to gеt horny
And to grind it with you all-all night
They just open up their wallеts

And you still want to sit on top of my dick

And that she dares to do it with Benito and Rauw, hehe

2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know

I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around

Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone

They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars

Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now

And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh

I have listened to my heart for a long time
And the days and months pass, thinking of your smell (Your smell, your smell)
The time has come to start reasoning
Before it's too late and I accidentally break in half (Break in half)

Before the sun comes up, step on the gas
Even if you don't have a brake and lose control
It'll only be us two, you and I caressing each other
In the midst of time, not saying goodbye

And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that, I am finе, today I have been reborn

I haven't hеld somebody's hand in a while
I haven't sent a ""Good morning, I love you"" in a while
But you've got me entangled, I got involved
I was on my own way and I got lost (Ayy, ayy)
My gaze changed when I saw your eyes (Your eyes)
Bye-bye to the booties, I didn't even say goodbye to them
I didn't look for you, no, we bumped into each other through our path
Your soul is the one I connect with (Street)
Stay calm, it doesn't have to be perfect, no
There are no sins here and making mistakes is beautiful
Mistakes are pleasures, just like all your little kisses

And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that I am fine, today I have been reborn
And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that I am fine, today I have been reborn

You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

I don't allow myself to be carried away
I only get carried away by your smile
And the mole near your lips
If I'm crazy, you're crazier
But baby, there's nobody like you, no
I want to give you sunflowers
Go to the beach and get seashells for you
When I'm with you, I don't look at the Role'
Let's dance to two hundred songs
Nobody turns me on the way you do
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm
I talk to God and you are his answer
I learned that pretty moments are priceless
Like when you gift me your gaze
And the sun its setting and the sun its setting
Hey, hey, when I'm on top of you, of you
Mami, I forget everything, everything
Nobody is needed here, just you and me

Before the sun comes up, step on the gas
Even if you don't have a brake and lose control
It'll only be us two, you and I caressing each other
In the midst of time, not saying goodbye

Przytulamy się i, tak, kochamy
I zawsze po prostu mów dobranoc (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I przytulamy się, jasne, uwielbiam to
Ale potrzebuję twoich ust na moich

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh
To tylko zasada
Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh

Ja, czuję się jak kurwa coś
Ale moglibyśmy być ckli, pieprzyć to
Cukier, nie jestem głupkiem, głupkiem
Lubię mówić, ""A co jeśli?"" Ale jeśli
Moglibyśmy się pocałować i po prostu pokroić śmieci
Wtedy mogę być na czymś
Nie dam ci jеdnego publicznie
Daję ci setki, piеprzyć to
Coś, w co po prostu musimy się dostać
Znak pierwszy, środkowy, ostatni na zębie mądrości
Czarnuchy żałują, że cipka jest budką do pocałunku
Spróbuj śniadania, lunchu, ginu i soku
I ta kolacja też jak deser
A kiedy my Francuzi, odśwież, daj mi dwa
Kiedy przygryzę tę wargę, przyjdź po mnie też
Chce szminkę, błyszczyk do ust, malinkę też, huh

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?

Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la

Powiedz, daj mi złotówkę, potrzebuję tych gushy rzeczy
Przesuń granicę, nie, nie jesteś wystarczająco dobry
Wszystkie twoje czarnuchy mówią, że przegrałeś beze mnie
Wszystkie moje suki czują się, jakbym unikł hrabstwa
Pieprzyć się z tobą czuć się jak więzienie, czarnuchu (Czuj się jak więzienie)
Nie mogę nawet wydychać, czarnuchu (Wydech)
Cipka jak święty Graal, wiesz o tym (Święty Graal)
Sprawisz, że będę potrzebował kaucji, wiesz o tym
Przyłapany na zanurzaniu się z twoim przyjacielem
Nie jesteś nawet w połowie, człowieku, kłamiesz na swoim ****, wiesz o tym

Kontroluj, nie zwalniaj tempa, jeśli odrzucę

98,99,"""One Mississippi""",Kane Brown,"14 ContributorsOne Mississippi Lyrics
You and I
Had this off and on so long
You've been here, then you've been gone
So many times
And every night
Yeah, I'm always bumpin' into you
We do the same things we used to
It's your place or it's mine, so

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Mm, every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are
And it's fire, you're like this Bourbon, hundred proof
Yeah, they don't burn the way you do
Yeah, we're better in the dark, so

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Hey

Kinda like that Georgia wind
We'll be gone and back again
But always wind up right back where we are
Playin' roulette with our hearts
And blowin' smoke rings in the dark, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are","country, country pop, bro-country, contemporary country, electropop"

I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist

I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town

So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote

Drivin' circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
Drivin' circles around this town
Hey


I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
I still get lost, I still get found
Drivin' circles around this town

Oh, yeah","country, singer-songwriter, country pop, female vocalists, pop"
