Yeehaw
Mmmmm
You know what I done, done
Mmmmm

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
{Kio, Kio)

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots, that's black to match
Riding on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I've been in the valley, you ain't been up off that porch now

Can't nobody tell me nothing
You tryna tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothang
You can't tell me nothing

I like me a bitch out the gutter (Uh-huh)
I like me a bitch that can hustle (Uh-huh)
I light up her wrist, had to bust her
She wanna pop a G6 wit me (Go)
Then I bought her a G63 (Skrrrt)
Then I had gave her the recipe (Woo)
Look at her, now she the best of me (Best)
Wondering why she obsessed with me (Sexy)
You niggas don't get as fresh as me (Nah)
Bought her the Tiffany, Patek Phillipe (Go)
Just like a baby, I rock her to sleep
Take the bitch to France, make her diamonds dance
She done seen the Lamb', taking off her pants
This a hundred bands, no, it's not a scam
This is Marni Bucket, and, it was made of lamb (Marni)
No, I wasn't lucky, I was in the jam
Man, I came from nothing, I was serving pounds
I've been getting money, I can run the Town
Baby girl, you lucky, I can spend it now (Whoo)

Can't nobody tell me nothing
You tryna tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothang
You can't tell me nothing

Riding on a tractor, lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby, you can go and ask her
My life is a movie, bull riding and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci, wrangler around my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothing
You tryna tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more

Hat down, cross Town living like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: Diamond Rings and Fendi Sport Brawls
Riding down Rodeo in my Masarati Sports-Car
Got no stress, I've been thru all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that Old Town Road
I wanna ride till I can't no more

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more

Masarati Rowdy got a V-12 for my bride (Skrrrt)
Foggy Rocky Road got a 3-wheeler inside (Ayy)
All I wanna do is take a pill, catch a chill vibe
Real prince, uh, I'm really the real don
(I'mma take....) I'ma take a horse to the Southberry Road
I don't remember her name but I painted on her nose (Ay)
Country money, I don't gotta do no chores
I'm a menace, I've got women tryna sneak me thru they doors (Skrrrt)

Can't nobody tell me nothing
You can't tell me
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You can't tell me, you can't tell me

(Brrrrrrt)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Who?)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Bitch!)
If it's us versus them, who you think gon' win? (Us)
Bet not drop that PIN (Drop it, drop it)
We gone spin again
I'ma spin (Spin, spin)
We gone slide (Slide)
Drop that PIN, pussy nigga, come outside (Come outside)
I been running out that chicken, I ain't tired (Dough)
Ain't shed another tear since when my grandma died (Grandma, Grandma)
I got all white rose with the bloody guts inside (Yup)
Think shit sweet then try it, step in the shoes, they not yo size (Niggas ain't stepping)
The back of the Maybach, I sit in recline (Think about what)
And I got Franklins all on my mind then chrome the spin (What else)
Chrome the 9 (Then what)
Bullet proof the ride (Skrrrrrrrrt!)
We spin the block and yell our ""He ain't outside!"" (Where he at)
Heard we had a wedding, he must be the bride (Shit)
I take them pies, subtract them & divide (Take on!)
Fuck the other shit, I'm going for the win (Fucking win)
Pulled up with that bitch then pulled up with his friends (Skrrrt)

Hold up, let me tell y'all something
You can't tell me nothing
Can't nobody tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing

Hop up in my RZR, got a thousand acres
Ride up on the cows with it, pray that it don't phase her
Ay-yo, Ay-yo
Yippe-o-kay-yay-ay-ay
If you ain't got giddy up then giddy out my way

I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road
I'm gonna ride till I can't no more

Huelga decir que lo mantengo bajo control
Ella era toda mal-mala, sin embargo (Sí)

Choqué en mi casa, bebé, eres un naufragio (Naufragio)
No hace falta decir que la estoy controlando
Ella estaba toda mal-mal, sin embargo
Ahora que te llamo, nena, me siento en un naufragio
Choca en mi casa, nena, eres un desastre
Pensando de mala manera, perdiendo tu agarre
Gritándome en la cara cara, nena, no tropieces
Alguien se fumó un porro grande, no sé cómo se sintió
Mirándote de lado, fiesta en Tilt
Uh, uh, algunas cosas que simplemente no puedes rechazar
Ella me quiere montar como un crucero y no estoy tratando de perder

Entonces te quedas en el polvo
A menos que me quede atrapado por ti
Eres el girasol, creo que tu amor sería demasiado
O te quedarás en el polvo, a menos que me quede atrapado por ti
Eres el girasol, eres el girasol

Cada vez que me alejo (Uh)
No me lo pones fácil, no (no, no)
Ojalá pudiera estar ahí para ti (Uh)

Puedo escucharte diciéndome que me dé la vuelta (Oh, oh)
Luchando por mi confianza y no retrocederás (No)
Incluso si tenemos que arriesgarnos todo ahora, oh (Ahora)
Sé que tienes miedo de lo desconocido (-conocido)
No quieres estar solo (solo)

Y te quedarás en el polvo, a menos que me quede atrapado por ti
Eres el girasol, creo que tu amor sería demasiado
O te quedarás en el polvo, a menos que me quede atrapado por ti

Últimamente, he estado, he estado pensando
Quiero que seas más feliz, quiero que seas más feliz

Cuando llega la mañana
Cuando vemos en lo que nos hemos convertido
En la fría luz del día, somos una llama en el viento
No el fuego que hemos iniciado
Cada discusión, cada palabra no podemos retractar
Por todo lo que ha pasado
Creo que sabemos la forma en que termina esta historia

Luego por solo un minuto
Quiero cambiar de mеnte
Porque esto no sе siente bien para mí
Quiero levantar tus ánimos
Quiero verte sonreír pero
Sé que significa que tendré que irme

Sé que significa que tendré que irme
Últimamente, he estado, he estado pensando
Quiero que seas más feliz, quiero que seas más feliz

Cuando llega la tarde
Y me quedo con mis pensamientos
Y la imagen de ti estando con otra persona
Bueno, me está comiendo por dentro
Pero corrimos nuestro curso, fingimos que estábamos bien
Ahora si saltamos juntos, al menos podemos nadar
Lejos del la ruina que hicimos

Luego por solo un minuto
Quiero cambiar de mente
Porque esto no se siente bien para mí
Quiero levantar tus ánimos
Quiero verte sonreír pero
Sé que significa que tendré que irme

Okul otobüsünün arkasındaki ışığın dibinde öpüşürdük eskiden
Ah be, baban pek benden hoşlanmazdı
Ve ona senin benim için doğru kişi olduğun söylediğimde bana bir parça bile inanmadı
Ah ama kız her gece pencereden sızıp dışarı çıkmanın yolunu buldu

Ve sen de biliyorsun bunu biz her gün

Bebeğim, biliyorsun sen de bu geceliğine sadece bir yerlere sıvışmak istiyorum
Istediğim her yere gidebiliriz

Sahile doğru süreriz arabayı, atla koltuğa
Yalnızca elimi tut benim ve benle gel, evet

Şimdilerdeyse hayat denen şeyi daha da ciddiye almak zorunda kaldık
Bizi kariyer sahibi yapmayacak işlerimiz ve ödememiz gereken faturalarımız
Eski dostlarımıza ve tanıdık düşmanlara sahibiz
Küçük bir çocuk olduğum zamana dönüp düşünüyorumda

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips

But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up

Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel

Run that back, Turbo

Ты можешь купить самую большую сумку Chanel, если ты хочешь
Я дал им дрипа, они высосали его, я заставил их стонать
Я купил новый Patek, у меня были часы, так что я их наложил друг на друга
Принимая наркотики, я буду на ногах до утра
Это не твоя машина, ты просто арендатор, ты ей не владеешь
Если я буду в клубе, я зажигаю во время выступления
Доход доходит до меня в размере сотни
Запах galore, милое дерьмо, это всё на нас
Я из Атланты, где молодые ниггеры заправляют дерьмом
Я знаю, они ненавидят меня, но я не читаю комментарии
Каждый раз, когда я говорю ей прийти, она приходит
Каждый раз, когда на нас бычат, мы не бежим

Дрип слишком сильный, не стой слишком близко
Наебнёшься и утонешь в этой волне
Даю концерты, я был в дороге
Мне всё равно, куда я иду, пока мне платят
Плохое настроение, она была у меня на уме
Как только я возвращаюсь, ебу её как зверь
Делаю это всё время, это не удивительно
Каждую ночь снимаю с ней очередной фильм
Дрип слишком сильный, не стой слишком близко
Наебнёшься и утонешь в этой волне
Даю концерты, я был в дороге
Мне всё равно, куда я иду, пока мне платят
Плохое настроение, она была у меня на уме
Как только я возвращаюсь, ебу её как зверь
Делаю это всё время, это не удивительно
Каждую ночь снимаю с ней очередной фильм

Е, каждую вторую ночь зарабатываю доллар
Каждый вечер начинается с хорошего дня
Я чувствую себя ребенком, у меня сопли на лице
Бриллианты танцующий в циферблате, как будто на параде
Мне не нужна твоя цепочка, молодой GonWunna не раб
Я должен был провести черту, слишком много сучек были спасены
TSA донимает меня, так что я сел на частный  самолет
Эти пиздюки, вот почему я работаю над своей целью
Дрип слишком сильный (Слишком сильный), опустошаю на карточку (Карточку)
Дизайнер на земле, я едва могу произнести имена
Дрип слишком сильный, осторожно на полу
Наебнёшься и утонешь на этой волне

Дрип слишком сильный, не стой слишком близко
Наебнёшься и утонешь в этой волне
Даю концерты, я был в дороге
Мне всё равно, куда я иду, пока мне платят
Плохое настроение, она была у меня на уме
Как только я возвращаюсь, ебу её как зверь
Делаю это всё время, это не удивительно

Kurt y yo sentimos lo mismo, demasiado placer es dolor
Mi chica me escupe en vano, todo lo que hago es quejarme
Necesita que algo cambie, necesito salir del margen
Así que a la mierda todo esta noche
Y no me digas que me calle
Cuando sabes que hablas demasiado
Pero no tienes una mierda que decir (Decir)

Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado
No soy bueno con las despedidas

Los dos estamos actuando como locos, pero somos demasiado tercos para cambiar
Ahora estoy bebiendo otra vez, con 80 grados de alcohol en mis venas
Y mis dedos se tiñeron, mirando por encima del borde
No me jodas esta noche
Dijiste que necesitabas este corazón, ahora lo tienes (Lo tienes)
Resulta que no era lo que querías (Querías)
Y como no lo soltabamos, lo perdimos
Ahora soy un desahuciado

Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza (Cabeza)
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado (Salvado, también)
No soy bueno con las despedidas

Te quiero fuera de mi vida
Te quiero de vuelta aquí esta noche
Estoy tratando de cortarte, sin cuchillo
Quiero rebanarte y cortarte en cubitos
Mi argumento es posesivo, te hizo preciso
¿No puedes apagar el televisor? Estoy viendo la pelea

Eres una muñeca de Barbie, como Nicki Minaj
No necesitas una llave para conducir, tu coche tiene el cargador
Solo quiero ver el lado, ese que no es molestado (Sí)
Y no quiero que nunca salgas afuera (Afuera)
Prometo que si te engañan, mis colegas aparecerán (Aparecerán)

Paizão, você já sentiu os tecidos da Chanel? (Chanel)
Vou ser estiloso até a morte, preciso de um caixão (Estiloso)
E temos mais listras do que o árbitro, ele falta, TEC nele (Bow, listras)
No meio do campo igual o David Beckham (Campo, bow-bow)
Todos os meus manos presos, de verdade, tô tentando ajudá-los (Liberdade, Liberdade)
Quando eu ganhei um milhão, me deu arrepios, não sei o que aconteceu (Hoo, arrepios)
Tomo pílulas, faço o que eu quero, eu tô naquele zumbi (Hey, hoo)
Eu sou mais o Gaddafi, não sou nenhum Gandhi (Gaddafi, hey)
Eu sou mais o David, Golias correndo (Hey, hey)
Os manos são clonados, eu acho engraçado (Clone, haha)

300, o relógio tá fora do seu orçamento (Woo, woo, 300)
A maldade me pegou
Yeah, e essa arma saiu direto da Rússia

Água gelada, virou Atlântica (Congelou)
De noite em um Phantom (Skrrt, Skrrt)
Falei pra essas putas não entrarem em pânico
Tomei uma ilha, (Yeah) inundou a mansão (Muita água)
Abaixei o teto, mais expansão
Dirija um carro em que você possa ficar (It's lit)
Vejo as vadias cobertas (Nos lençóis)
Eu sou um amante de bundas e peitos (Bunda grande)
Acho que todos nós fizemos um pro outro
Agora que todos os parças estão livres (Yeah, yeah)
E estamos fora nessas ruas (Tudo bem)
Você pode fazer isso, você pode rebolar pra mim?

Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)

Em um Hellcat porque eu fui criado no inferno
Homem feito, eu não devo favor pra nenhum mano
Quando você conseguir esse dinheiro, mano, mantenha seu coração
Eu tô deslizando no carro, não precisa de chave pra ligar
Eu levo a arma comigo no BET Awards
Quando seu poço secar, você sabe que precisa de mim pra isso
Quando eu estaciono no Buick, você sabe o que tô fazendo
Se a polícia ficar atrás de mim, eu vou fugir e vazar
Dormindo na paleta me transformou em um selvagem
Eu sou um bebê do projeto, agora moro em Calabasas
Como se eu ainda servisse aos demônios, como se ainda estivesse afirmando
Eu tô bebendo lean, tento manter o equilíbrio
Andando naquela Z-Walk, Dickie's com meus Reeboks
Eu não falo muito, apenas deixo a arma falar
Suas joias mexem na água, diamantes tipo re-rock
Minha mina cavalga no pau como se tivesse numa gangorra
Quando eu entrei na cena, eu tava com uma mira
Quando eu entrei na Beam', eu tava de Celine
Garotinha, você é apenas uma aventura, não é isso que quero dizer
Dinheiro pulando pra fora do meu jeans, igual eu faço o esquema

Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)

Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)

Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

Poor me, pour me another round

And see the world through whiskey glasses

Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight

Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stunting, I like shining
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin'
I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (the coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah they call me Cardi B, I run this shit like cardio
Oh, damn

Cardi B

They reload, they reload, but don't pull the trigger (pull the trigger!)
You buy all the Jordan's, fool, they gift them to me
I spend in the club (woo), what you have in the bank (yeh)
This is the new religion, bang, in Latino gang, gang, yeh
I try to diet (yeh), but in the closet I got too much fat (woo!)
I already moved the Gucci to inside my house, yeh (woo!)
Motherfucker, nobody knows you, not even in Plaza (no)
The Devil calls me but Jesus Christ hugs me (amen)
Guerrero like Eddie, long live the race (yeh)
I like Boricuas, I like Cubans 
I like the accent of the Colombians (what's going on?)
I like how she shakes the ass the Dominican (what's up?)
How good they fuck me the Venezuelans (woo!)
We are active, Perico Pin Pin (woo)
Hundred dollar bills in the briefcase (ching)
Let the bass resound, Bobby Valentin, yeh
Love is forbidden here, tell them, Charytín
For their itching I got Claritin

And go to hell, motherfucker, we aren't gonna pass you the hookah (hookah, hookah)
My Balenciaga shoes, they receive me in the entrance (woo)

And don't play dumb (hey), in covers of Billboard you have seen me (hey)
I don't leave your head (woo)
Everywhere you go you have heard ""Mi Gente""
I'm not high, I'm like the Testarossa ('rossa)
I'm the one who lives it and enjoys it (enjoys it, enjoys it)
That's the thing, baby that's the thing (thing, thing)
The one who looks suffers and the one who touches enjoys (enjoys, enjoys)

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly

Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

Girl you know I've known you forever

Round this old dance floor

Making a motion like ""'Could y'all get any closer?""
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?

Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby

Öldür onları, al onları, al onları, oh
Onları almaya çalışıyorum
Oh, oh al onları
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ne istiyorsun ? Dediğimi tekrarlamayacağım
Gece gelen bir hırsızım (Gece olunca hırsızım)

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Sana bebeğim dersem, sadece bir günlüğüne öylesindir
Veya sadece bir geceliğine, sen benim karım olamazsın
Bütün gece sevişmek için bir katil arıyor
Ben ise bir fahişe, tüm gece sakso çeksin bana
Saatim AP, büyük parçacıklı, ekibimle birlikte mahallemdeyim
5.000 harcadım akşam yemeğine, bir 300 de sen ateşle torbacıya

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Zenginim ama sürüyorum, alışmakta sıkıntı çekiyorum, Öfkelenip daha fazlasını kazanmak üzereyim
Böylesini görmemiştim, tonla para üstümde, Yüz binlerim çantamda bu çok tatlı bir iş
Baby OG, koşuşturuyordum bu sokaklarda, Lashawn'dan öğrendim piyasayı, ben annemin oğluyum
Gençken dinim hakkında bir şeyler öğrendim, İşlerin yürümediğini biliyordum ve kaptım elime silahı
Sırf Dior alabilmek için Paris'e gittim
Hatun ilgi için yalvarıyor, siklemiyorum onu
Huzur içinde yat Pop, keşke bizi görebilseydin
Ben ve CashMoney ne zaman gitsem buluşuyoruz
Caddelerde adamlarım gezer, beni yenemezsin
Ben olmaya çalışan bir endüstri var
Ray Charles'a gidiyorum, beni göremiyorlar
RiRi ile Rolls-Royce'dayım

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Geceleri bir hırsız gibi
Uğradım ve ona bu gecelik için D verdim
Arabanın içinde sevişmeye çalışıyor, bu kadar yeter
Koltuklarımın üstünde yapamayız çünkü beyaz renkteler (Bunlar benim koltuklarım orospu çocuğu koltuklarıma bak)
''Thriller'' klibinde gibi yaşıyorum hayatı sadece gece vakti dışarı çıkıyorum
Hatun likör kullanmıyor, içkili olmayı sevmiyor
Hatun Hennesy içmiyor, sadece beyaz şarap
Patlattım Pinot Grigio marka şarabı
Porsche ile yanaşıyorum, yanımda fena bir kaltak
Porshce'u park edip Lambo'ya atlıyorum
İniyorum, Major Payne, kamuflaj giyiniyorum
Sevimli hatunu sevişmeye zorladım, sevgilisini bıraktı
Ateş etmeyi ve seni sevindirmeyi severim, ben Ramboyum
Cuban Chain elmaslarla dolu, boynumu boğuyor adeta
Huzur içinde yat Pop, ölümün yaktırdı bana bir cigara

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim

And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said you loved me first (First)
One thing my dad told me was
""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time you're insecure""
I can't see it through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave for my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs, so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave for my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it","trap, rap, emo rap, Hip-Hop, pop"
