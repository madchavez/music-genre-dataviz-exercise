Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say, ""Please, please, please don't go away""
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe (Huh) you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for somethin' more

Yes I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I'll just have to wait
Because I've got to have faith
I gotta have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion

Could've been so beautiful

What could've been on a cold and lonely night

The memories of our loving still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere

Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all

Some dreams are in the nighttime
And some seem like yesterday

Ships sail away

Forty-seven deadbeats living in the back street
North, east, west, south, all in the same house
Sitting in a back room, waiting for the big boom
I'm in a bedroom waiting for my baby

She's so mean, but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west

Well, Mandy's in the backroom, handing out Valium
Sheriff's on the airwaves, talking to the DJs
Forty-seven heartbeats beating like a drum
Got to live it up, live it up, Ronnie's got a new gun

She's so mean, but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west

Now put your flags in the air and march them up and down
You can live it up, live it up all over the town
And turn to the left, turn to the right

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)

Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites

When you make love, do you look in your mirror?
Who do you think of? Does he look like me?
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever?
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Okay
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing, or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No

Am I getting through or do you please yourself?

All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before
Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh
And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights
I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh
Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine

There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover
But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true

I could never love again the way that I loved you
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason

I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry
Be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry
Be happy, don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed

He may have to litigate
But don't worry
Be happy, look at me, I'm happy

Don't worry, be happy (Hey, I'll give you my phone number, when you worry, call me, I'll make you happy)
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry
Be happy
'Cause when you worry, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry
Be happy, don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry
Be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
But don't worry
Be happy, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass, whatever it is

I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms, count 'em, one, two, three

And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug

My heart's all tangled up, my tongue is tied
It's crazy

Can't eat, can't sleep

With a kiss, you can strip me defenseless
With a touch, I completely lose control

The helpless heart just can't resist their power

Someone who relies on you

But the thought of you just caves me in
The symptoms are so deep
It is so much too late
To turn away
We started out as friends

Sign your name across my heart

Than in cool Heaven

Before the day is gone
But oh the light shines brighter
On a peaceful day
Stranger blue, leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love
And the Earth rotates to our dictates
Slowly we make love

I am so in love with you

You can read me like a book
Just like a fortune teller
Everybody needs a fortune teller

You bring me feelin'

You are always there

And if I ever lose my way
You're always there to guide me

Anyone can see it

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make somethin'
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on drivin'

So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car

Hey, yo, cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was being real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high-post but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Something to fill in the holes

Some shine and some keep you guessing
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson

Don't you know what it's saying?
We should feel it together
Forever
Feel the beat and just hold on
To the sweet midnight flowing
Feel the music inside you
I'll be there, too

Now's the time our dreams are finally coming true
Feels so good we're crying
Now's the time when it's down to me and you
Spread these wings, we'll be flying

Don't you know when it's touching you?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Time to show all your feeling
All the night is revealing
Let the rhythm enfold you
Let me hold you
Now we turn into music
Now we will never lose it
When the rhythm and night ride
No heart can hide

There are times that never ever come again
Memories there for the making
When the night calls, we better let it in
All this love for the taking

But not alone

Fought every gain

When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity, mm

I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Hoping you might change your mind
And call me up to say

And (last)
That's it, that's it

Some folks say easy come is easy go
(And some folks say)
But one night ain't enough for me
Girl, hang on tight and don't let go
This must be just like livin' in paradise (it's just like paradise, hey)
And I don't wanna go home (and I ain't never goin' home)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (just like, just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home, wow
Ho ho, ho
Aw yeah
Whoo
This must be just like livin' in paradise (in paradise, paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (and I don't, I don't wanna go)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (never , I'm never goin' home)
And I don't wanna go home (wow, 1-800-SEE-YA, ho)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (wow, hey hey)
(Just like paradise)
This must be just like livin' in (just like) paradise","hard rock, rock, 80s, classic rock, hair metal"

Woo, mm, yeah
Hahahaha
Hoo, yow
Woo, hahaha, yeah
Now listen

Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night, I'd like to make my girl
But right now, I can't make ends meet, no

I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from the same ol', same ol'
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

Say I spend my money on women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
I'm real sorry 'bout the shape I'm in
I just like my fun every now and then

I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from the same ol', same ol'
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

You see I
I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breakin' our backs every day
If wanting a good life is such a crime
Lord, then, put me away, yeah, here's to ya

Mm, guitar

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

It don’t get better, baby","hard rock, hair metal, 80s, rock, classic rock"

Now I only wanna say I love you one more time
Wait - just a moment before our love will die

Wait - just a moment and tell me why
Cause I - can show you lovin' that you won't deny
Wait - and show your lovin' like it was before
Cause I - won't let that feelin' walk out through the door
I said wait - just a moment and try once more
'Cause babe - I need to hold you like I did before
So if you go away - I know that I will follow
'Cause there's a place inside my heart that tells me
Hold out, hold out, hold out

Prove your love
Got to prove your love
Ooh, yeah

I heard all about what you can do
But I've got to know, is it true?
You're telling me to trust, what should I believe?
You promise so much, but talk is cheap

You tell me that you're serious
But I got to know for sure
You say how much you want me
But I've heard it all before

Prove your love
Got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff
'Cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mine

Boy, I can feel a love's on the rise
A message revealed in your eyes
You know I can't wait to know your passion
It's not too late, so take some action

Can you say that when you're through
I'll know what love is all about?
Well, baby, I've been patient
Now I'm ready to find out

Prove your love
Got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff
'Cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talk to mine


You can tell me that you're serious
But I got to know for sure
You say how much you want me
But I've heard it all before

Prove your love
Got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff
'Cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body
