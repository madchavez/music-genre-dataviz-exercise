Whoa, oh, yeah

(Ah) I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
(Ah) Why do I bother

How could a person like you bring me joy?

I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side

I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
'Cause I stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart

I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
And when (And when) just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
Cause as the time turns the page, my love won't age at all

The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love

Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

That a hero lies in you

You say I only hear what I want to

And I thought what I felt was simple

'Cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah, I missed you

And you say I only hear what I want to

To the distance that you're running to anyone, anywhere

I'm only hearing negative, no, no, no (Bad)

So I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
Lovers in love and the others run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the other
Who was dying since the day they were born, well
Well, this is not that
Think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever
But now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
That won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you

You said that I was naive and
I thought that I was strong, oh
I thought, ""Hey, I can leave, I can leave""
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong

'Cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you

You said you caught me 'cause you want me
And one day, you'll let me go
You try to give away a keeper
Or keep me 'cause you know you're just so scared to lose

I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my
Mind

""How can I be strong?"" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions, you had many
I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you
Ooh, it felt so good and
Ooh, so right

""How can I be strong?"" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
I don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mack ****
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like 7-Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, yeah, he's a  mighty, mighty good man)

You know what I'm sayin'? He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Y'all don't hear me, now check him out

My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker, 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that (I've got a good man)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, a mighty, mighty good man)

But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil

Regulators
We regulate any stealin' of his property
We're damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean
Earn your keep
Regulators, mount up

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission, tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said, ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard, they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said, ""Damn, what's next?""

They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings, I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate


I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up, back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

Just like I thought, they were in the same spot, in need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell, I said, ""Ooh, I like your size""
She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice, would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel


I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare you
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm

If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this

As we stroll along together
Holding hands walking all along
So in love are we two
That we don't know what to do
So in love (So in love)
In a world of our own (So in love)

And as we walk by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
So in love (So in love)
So much in love (So in love)
So in love (So in love)
So much in love (So in love)

We stroll along together
I tell you I need you oh so much
I love, I love you, my darling
Can you tell it in my touch?

As we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die
So in love are we two
Just can't wait to say, ""I do""
So in love (So in love)
In a world of our own (So in love)
So in love (So in love)
Are you and I (So in love)

Baby, I hope you realize that you mean so much to me
You're everything I ever wanted in a woman
To touch you, to feel your body close to me
I just want to hold you in my arms forever
I love you, baby

As we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die

The song samples The Sweet Inspirations' song “I’m Blue.”
Hey, yeah
I wanna shoop, baby (Shoop)
Ooh, how you doing, baby? (Shoop)
No, not you, you (Shoop)
The bow-legged one, haha, yeah, what’s your name? (Shoop)
Damn, baby, that sounds sexy, uh (Shoop)

Here I go, here I go, here I go again (Again)
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!) Okay then
Chilling, chilling, minding my business (Word)
Yo Salt, I looked around and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it going on with something kinda, uh (Shoop)
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy, so I asked for the digits (Shoop)
A ho, no, that don't make me
See what I want, slip-slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks on him (Shoop)
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop-shoop-shoop (Shoop)

Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (Thanks, Mom)
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie?
If looks could kill you would be an Uzi
Or a shotgun, bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know, How does it hang? (Shoop)
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha— well, uh (Shoop)
I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile
Smooth Black skin with a smile (Shoop)
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun
Come and give me some of that yum-yum chocolate chip (Come on, come on)
Honey dip, can I get a scoop? (Please)

Bet your bottom dollar you are best under pressure

You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun

Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

With all my soul, I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain?
This taste of heaven, so deep, so true
I've found in you

So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me, out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Lettin' each one burn, down to his thick fingers
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' the party has just begun

But I'll never stop dreamin' of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me somethin' I can take home?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now, I can do that
Oh, oh, now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwin' around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love

But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin', growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found
Many trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore

About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed (Brother, freeze, boy)
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MCs for dinner
You're crazy like that glue (Crazy, boy, you're crazy)
To think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
(Shake 'em down, Mack)
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time (Haa, boy)
‘Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position (Knock 'em out, boy)
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack (Make it crack)
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (Here comes the brand new flava in your ear, boy)
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear (Mack's the brand new flava now)
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (Flava, flava)
Time for new flava in ya ear (Here comes the flava)
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear (Flava in ya ear, boy)
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than the Pope
But for MCs more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MCs shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MCs will run like a bomb threat
I bet (What?), or better yet (Huh?), make you sweat
Getting hotter than the Sun get (Yeah)
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet (Rocks, boy)
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MCs, stop relaxin'
This brand new sheriff that's in towns
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground (Rest in peace)
I set up rhymes for a decoy (Boom, boy)
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MCs I destroy, and

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (Time for new flava)
Time for new flava in ya ear (Flava)
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear (Time for new flav)
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear (Boy, here comes the Mack!)
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (I'm pickin' up with the flava)
Time for new flava in ya ear (Flava)

Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah!

Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependent see
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not takin' it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gon' come to ya til you do right by me

I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe...hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)?
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holding a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday, you'll change your mind""

And Johnny said

Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Beau
Take anybody that you want
As long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to
There won't be any harm""

And Johnny said

Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one
And she says, ""It's time to go""
Doctor says, ""The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his mama's fading fast""
And Johnny hit his knees

And there, he prayed

Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world

But you won't even talk to me to tell me what it is you see in me

The word got around from my crew in Brooklyn and in the Boogie Down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date, and wait, swing with me
I got your cards, you're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong, and if it's on, I keep it soft and wet

Wasn't checking for me 'cause you had a friend already

#1 on Adult Contemporary charts in January 1995.
Please, baby, can't you see
My mind's a burnin' hell
I got razors a-rippin' and tearin' and strippin'
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for somethin' new
And some other woman is lookin' like somethin'
That might be good for you

Go on and hold her 'til the screamin' is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across a fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please, baby, can't you see
I'm tryin' to explain
I've been here before and I'm lockin' the door
And I'm not goin' back again
Her eyes and arms and skin
Won't make it go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

Go on and hold her 'til the screamin' is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across a fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one


Go on and hold her 'til the screamin' is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across a fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one, yeah
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone

Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I remember (Back in the days)
When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it, so
When he went out with girls I could go tagging along, nagging
If she had a sis, maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985?
All the way live, I think I was about 10
One of those happy little niggas singing the blues
That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin' ""Yo momma black,"" his momma ""this,"" his momma ""that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about–10 minutes, then it's like–back on the bike
To play hide-and-go-get-it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playing Ding Dong Ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearing Gazelles
And if they really had money, rays be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they Turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce, then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
What? (Back in the day) When? (Back in the day)

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87, '88
That's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school (Wish it had blown up)
No doubt, I couldn't wait to get out (And be a grown-up)
But let me finish this reminiscing and telling
'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys, like–for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eating pickles, with Tootsie Pops, and it don't stop
I'm glad, 'cause when J.J. Fad did ""Supersonic""
It was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans, and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies had ""Poison"" airbrushed on they asses
Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with the fat laces
'Cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got 'til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce, then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
What? (Back in the day) When? (Back in the day)

Well, it's the niggarole,
I figure that now I'm all grown up, because I'm 18 years old
And guess you could say I'm holding down a steady job and
Crew steady mobbing, you steady bobbing
Your head, and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central LA
That's where I stayed, and figured a way out
I gave it all I had, so for what it's worth –
I went from rags to riches, which is a drag, but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones'es is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did – but
Sometimes I still sit and reminisce, then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

We fell in love
And who could blame us?
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
Now they wonder why we didn't last
We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder love came to an end

And our feelings just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings, yeah, just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
Who don't know

We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared, they didn't help
Makes me wonder, should we blame ourselves?
So here we are brokenhearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody says to let it end, baby
Well, it makes me wonder, we can't let them win

And our feelings, just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
Don't you know that our feelings just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

If we'd only just try, we could make it by
And maybe in time, we could make it right
If we only had done what we should've done
We'd both be here still making love
I wanna know that, that we can go back
Back to a time when the loving was all that
When no one could come between our love

And our feelings just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers from people we don't know
And our feelings, just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
