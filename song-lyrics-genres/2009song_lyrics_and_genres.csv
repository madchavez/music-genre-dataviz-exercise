We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies
It's on and poppin tonight 'cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot
'Cause we be ballin', it's platinum Patron that be ours

Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands

My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl, won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage

I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me

Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now, I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Mm, mm

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be
Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?

Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday

I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
We're all alone
Smokin' his last cigarette

When everything was fallin' apart?
Where all my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came

Haha, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause, boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes, love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)

Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA?
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seemed to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So, please, don't mess up the trick
""Hey Young World,"" I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?
OMG, you listen to that bitch?

I don't wanna fall back on my face again

Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy

Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy

No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy

Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

And she's an actress (Actress), but she ain't got no need

While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth

Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm

Lo siento viniendo en el aire (Sí)
Escucho los gritos en todos lados (Sí)
Soy adicta a la emoción (Estoy listo)
Es un amorío peligroso (¿Qué pasa? Vamos)
No puedo asustarme cuando eso viene bajo
Tienes un problema, dímelo ahora (¿Qué pasa?)
La única cosa que está en mi mente (¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Ah, ¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Sí, ¿Qué pasa? Sí)
Nosotros vamos a dirigir esta ciudad

Lo hacemos, sí, yo dije: lo hacemos
Este es Roc Nation, jura tu fidelidad
Ten tu uniforme puesto, de negro todo
Tarjetas negras, autos nеgros, de negro todo
Y nuestras chicas son pájaros nеgros yendo con los Dillinger
Profundizo más si estos chicos son lo suficientemente reales
Este es la Familia, te lo explicaré luego
Pero por ahora, déjame volver a este papel
Tengo un par de billetes guardados y estoy tratando de volver
Le di un apretón a Doug y perdí un flip por cinco pilas
Sí, estoy hablando de 5 comas, 6 ceros, punto cero, aquí Doug
De vuelta a correr en círculos alrededor de los negros, ahora nos cuadramos
Espera

La vida es un juego, pero no es justo (Sí)
Rompo las reglas, así que no me importa (Uh-huh)
Así que sigo haciendo mi propia cosa
Caminando alto contra la lluvia (¿Qué pasa?)
La victoria está dentro de la milla
Casi allí, no te rindas ahora (¿Qué pasa?)
La única cosa que está en mi mente (¿Qué pasa?)
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche (Uh, sí)
Ey, ey, ey, ey (¿Qué pasa?)
¿Quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche?

Lo hacemos, sí, yo dije: lo hacemos
Tú puedes llamarme Caesar, en un Caesar negro
Por favor sigue al líder, asi que, Eric B, lo hacemos
Microfono cruel, este es el regreso del dios
Paz, Dios, ah, ah, no hay nadie más fresco
Estoy en Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
En la mesa, gritando, ""Al carajo el otro lado! Ellos andan celosos!""
Tenemos un banquete lleno de chicas, ellas tienen una mesa llena de muchachos
Sí, y no están gastando en ningún pastel
Ellos deberían tirar sus manos allí porque ellos no tienen ninguna pica
Sí, todo mi equipo tiene dinero
Así que mi banquete se parece a ""Millionaires' Row""

La vida es un juego, pero no es justo
Rompo las reglas, así que no me importa
Así que sigo haciendo mi propia cosa
Caminando alto contra la lluvia
La victoria está dentro de la milla
Casi allí, no te rindas ahora
La única cosa que está en mi mente
Es quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche
Ey, ey, ey, ey
¿Quién va a dirigir esta ciudad esta noche?

Está loco como tú puedes ir de ser Joe Blow
A que todos estén en tu pene; no homo
Le compré a mi familia entera carros; no Volvos
La próxima vez estoy en la Iglesia: por favor, sin fotos
Escoltas policiales, pasaportes de todos
Esta es la vida que todos piden
Esta es la vida rápida, estamos en un curso acelerado
¿Para qué crees que rapeo, para promocionar un jodido Rav 4?
Pero sé que si me quedo atrofiado
Todas estas chicas solo van a querer una cosa
Puedo pasar toda mi vida de Good Will Hunting
Lo único bueno que viene es tan bueno cuando me ando viniendo
Ella tiene un culo que se tragará una tanga
Y por arriba, ungh, dos picaduras de abeja
Y estoy bebiendo el Riesling
Y mi negro acaba de salir de la comisaría
Nos importa un carajo el drama que tu amigo trae
Solo estoy tratando de cambiar el color de tu anillo de estado de ánimo
Reebok, nena, necesitas probar algunas cosas nuevas
¿Alguna vez has tenido zapatos sin cordones?
""¿Qué es eso, Ye?"" ""Nena, estos son tacones""
""Es eso un May— ¡¿Qué?!"" ""Nena estas son ruedas""
Te equivocas cuando no estás bebiendo, toma una recarga
Te sientes como si estuvieras corriendo, ¿huh? Ahora ya sabes cómo nos sentimos (¿Qué pasa?)

Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Yeoaw!)

Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gon' rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (Rock!)
And Pamela (Rock!) and Samantha (Rock!)
And Amanda and Tamara, ménage à moi
I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock
Just let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock

Let it rock
Let it rock

I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'
Ruling rock rubbin' rap runnin'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder

And I wish I could be as cruel as you
And I wish I could say the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie

No pain inside
You're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?

I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation (I know we did)
'Cause I won't remember, save your breath 'cause what's the use? (Ooh)

Ah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly, ""Come and play""
I, I am falling
And if I let myself go, I'm the only one to blame

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh, whoa, whoa)
No pain inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (Oh)

Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
I'm looking for myself sober
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
Looking for myself sober

When it's good then it's good, it's so good 'til it goes bad
'Til you're tryin' to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony and just tryin' to find a friend
Oh
Oh

Nothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)
But why do I feel this party's over? (But why do I feel this party's over?)

Mmm, nobody's talkin'
'Cause talkin' just turns into screamin', oh
And now as I'm yellin' over her, she yellin' over me

And what's even worse, that we don't
Even remember why we're fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing (Fighting for)

Mesdames et messieurs, voici le moment que vous attendiez tous
Dans ce coin-là, pesant 175 livres
Avec un palmarès de : 17 viols, 400 agressions et 4 meurtres
L'incontesté, le méchant le plus diabolique du monde : Slim Shady
Allez ouvres une bouteille, laisse ton corps bouger
Fais pas le mannequin snob, tu viens de tirer le gros lot
O-oh, o-oh, les putes grimpent dans ma Tahoe
Elles sont là sur la banquette arrière et aucune d'entre elles n'a de vêtements
Maintenant où sont les capotes ? Qui a les capotes ?
J'ai remarqué qu'elles étaient vraiment nombreuses contrairement à nous
Et les filles nous aiment et mon équipe fout la merde
On la terminera à l'aube cette fête qu'on commence au crépuscule

Okay, c'est parti
De retour avec Andre, le géant, monsieur défense d'éléphant
Tiens toi bien, ou tu ne seras qu'un mec de plus à mordre la poussière
Juste un des fils de ma mère qui s'est jeté sous le bus
Embrasse mon cul, lèche le fumunda cheese qui se trouve sous mes boules
Ça me dégoûte de voir le rap game dans cet état
C'est nécessaire que je redore mon blason et que les rageux s'inclinent
Le désir des salopes, mec elles adorent quand je me pose dans leur chatte
Une baston, la fille me donne sa thune en petite coupure
Maintenant regarde-nous, c'est ridicule la façon dont tu te compliques l'esprit
Parce que quand je crache mon couplet c'est pire qu'une sauce Worcestershire
Est-ce que je fais des photos parfaites avec des mots ? À chaque fois !
Chaque couplet, chaque ligne, aussi simple qu'une comptine
C'est évident, les éléphants sont entrés dans la pièce
J'peux dire qu'on est au centre de l'attention, c'est vrai
Sans même parler de mon envie de vengeance alors voilà le signal
Le bat-symbole, le trio de platine est de retour pour vous salopes

Allez ouvres une bouteille, laisse ton corps bouger
Fais pas le mannequin snob, tu viens de tirer le gros lot
O-oh, o-oh, les putes grimpent dans ma Tahoe
Elles sont là sur la banquette arrière et aucune d'entre elles n'a de vêtements
Maintenant où sont les capotes ? Qui a les capotes ?
J'ai remarqué qu'elles étaient vraiment nombreuses contrairement à nous
Et les filles nous aiment et mon équipe fout la merde
On la terminera à l'aube cette fête qu'on commence au crépuscule

Ladies and gentlemen : Dr. Dre !

Ils voient cette roulebas passer et se disent ""Oh mon""
T'as pas besoin de me dire pourquoi t'es pâle car je le sais déjà
Je rentre dans cette six trey comme un fou
Je suis une démangeaison qu'ils ne peuvent pas gratter, je les rend fous
Mais bon, qu'est-ce que je peux dire d'autre, j'adore L.A.​
Parce qu'après tout, ce n'est qu'un autre jour
Et celui commence quand le précédent s'arrête
On se donne rendez-vous là où on s'était quitté pour se défoncer de nouveau
Merde alors ! J'ai merdé et j'ai crashé ma Benz
Je conduis avec l'avant défoncé, laissons tomber celle-ci
J'en sors une autre du garage
La Monte Carlo, la Camino, ou la El Dorado
Putain qu'est-ce que j'en sais, est-ce que je veux des sièges en cuir ou en vinyle ?
Dur de choisir, Mon garage ressemble à Precision Collision
Ou Maaco, le beat tremble comme Waco
Garde les basses faibles et les haut-parleurs éloignés de ton visage

Allez ouvres une bouteille, laisse ton corps bouger
Fais pas le mannequin snob, tu viens de tirer le gros lot
O-oh, o-oh, les putes grimpent dans ma Tahoe

J'ai remarqué qu'elles étaient vraiment nombreuses contrairement à nous
Et les filles nous aiment et mon équipe fout la merde
On la terminera à l'aube cette fête qu'on commence au crépuscule

Et je prends un grand plaisir à vous présenter : 50 Cent !

C'est bouteille sur bouteille
L'argent n'est pas un soucis quand tu fais la fête avec moi
It's what we into, it's simple à traduire
On est tellement au-dessus, t'imagines même pas
Je suis le napalm, la bombe, le Don
Je suis King Kong, qui s'est fait sauté, tué et maintenant règne
Je suis tellement calme, au Viêt Nam, fais sonner l'alarme
Apporte le Chandon, allume la marijuana, fais ce que tu veux
Le négro est là, jusqu'à c'que quelque chose casse
Garde la thune mec, je suis en train de serrer, tu sais que j'en ai rien à foutre
I spend it like it don't mean nothing à traduire
Je la dépense comme elle est censé être dépensé, bâtard j'ai grandi
Je fais du stunt, j'ai du style, j'excelle
Putain, j'ai tout ce que je veux donc je trick
Des gros culs avec des sacs Birkin, classique
Des chaussures Jimmy Choo, je dis bouge, une salope bouge

Allez ouvres une bouteille, laisse ton corps bouger
Fais pas le mannequin snob, tu viens de tirer le gros lot

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

We're driving slow through the snow on Fifth Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is
The part where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Every day, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know (I know) this is (This is)
The part where the end starts

And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes

I can't take it any longer (Can't take this)
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger (It's slipping through our fingers)
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now (Try now)
All that's left's good-bye (Goodbye now)
To find a way that I can tell you (That I can tell you)

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Ooh, you can't give up (When you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough ('Cause you never know)
When it shows up (Make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one
The one you're waiting on

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

Be my mirror, my sword and shield

You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

Every night, I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I'm goin' out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)

Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)

I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up, you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

I don't know, but I think I may be fallin' for you
Droppin' so quickly
Maybe I should keep this to myself
Wait until I know you better

I am trying not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do, I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life, and now I found you
I don't know what to do, I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

As I'm standing here and you hold my hand
Pull me towards you and we start to dance
All around us, I see nobody
Here in silence, it's just you and me

I'm trying, not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head

My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride (Would you, would you?)

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (Would you, would you?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (Would you, would you?)
If today was your last day (Would you, would you?)
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
(try, try)
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life (Would you, would you?)

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (Would you, would you?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (Would you, would you?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (Would you, would you?)
And would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)

She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said, ""Y'all, get in""
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do? Baby, I don't care
We can go to the show or we can stay right here

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Said, ""We can fire it up and I can show you around""
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

And just let me dust off the seat, mhm
And put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah


Girl, you can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or, baby, if you'd rather

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass

When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire

Girl I'm in love with you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm trying to be yours

Radio killa

Now she the definition of fine
But I told her that her body looks better with mine. 

I like the way she rock, her hips
Them rockin' hips
Told her we can take off like rocket ships
Straight jacket jeans, you look crazy in em'
The way you rockin' that, I thought they were jay z denim
Let me drop a jewel on ya, put a roc in air
Can I call you nana cause you got that rockin' chair
It go back & forth- then forth & back
When I'm on patron or off the yak
Cnt get off the fact I'm off my mac
Goldie prolly wouldn't, but I would trick off of that
And I'm sick with the money, I can cough a stack
I can sneeze some g's so baby let's roll

She rockin' that shit like
The way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you gonna make a nigga fall in love
She rockin' that shit like
The way you rockin' that up in this club
There's nothing I can say 
She rockin' that shit like

Whoa, whoa
Look how shorty roll, roll
She rockin' that shit
I'm like look at shorty go, go
She rockin' to the beat, she rockin' it for me
And all I can think about is rockin' it to sleep
Her face is like a model
Body shape just like a bottle
Girl I wanna hit that more than I wanna hit the lotto
She revvin' me up, I got my hand on my throttle
I wanna get on top of her, zoom on the yamaha
So you can call it switchin' gears
Zoom inside of her
And if it taste how it look I'm a try to swallow her
Call me Mr. Shoe- shine, baby I'm a polish ya
And I leave ya spit clean, I dnt use no polisher
Demolition man, tell your friends I demolish ya
Plus I'm that nigga, baby I could make you popular
So get another shot of ciroc in ya
Cause I'm gon' be rockin' ya
Treat you like my first ladt
I'll put my barack in ya

Air force ones in my air force one (obama)
Is it all a dream? (no) sorry my reality

In a whole nother galaxy

Melt your imagination, & mold it into reality

Can you feel the pictures that I painted
Cause all of them are related like a mother & a son
But none of them overrated
There no others, you the one
Our destiny is to make it
Gotta thank you just for sharing your world
It's so real, an inspiration for no reason
But thinking that I'm incapable of taking on the duty of making you interchangable
The thought is sensational, it's perfect bliss
I'm ready to take the milky way to your hershey's kiss
You know my tongue's got batteries in it
The bedroom, we lose calories in it & start families in it
And dnt worry cause the situations under control
So let me dive in your heart & swim around in your soul (luda)

Take me, I'm yours, shorty
As we rock to the left, rock to the right

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home, you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise

I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
But I thought I loved you then

And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

And I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then

Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then

""Oh, what the hell?"" she says ""I just can't win for losin'""

And by the light of the moon, she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind

And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad, then I do, too
So, I let her be

And she says, ""Ooh

And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it

It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin' down
Way down

Well, she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

'Til by the light of the moon, she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So, I sit down and I cry, too

Puede que no signifique nada para todos ustedes
Pero entiende, no se hizo nada por mi
Así que no planeo detenerme en absoluto
Quiero esta mierda para siempre, melena, siempre, melena, siempre, melena
Estoy cerrando mierda en el centro comercial
Y diciéndole a cada chica que ella es la única para mí
Y ni siquiera estoy planeando llamar
Quiero esta mierda para siempre, melena, siempre, melena, siempre, melena

Apellido ""Siempre"", primer nombre 'El Mejor""
Como un esguince de tobillo, chico, no tengo nada con lo que jugar
Comenzó localmente, pero gracias a todos los haters
Conozco a los pilotos de G-IV por su nombre de pila
En tu ciudad, se desvaneció del marrón, Nino
Ella insiste en que tiene más clase, lo sabemos
Nadando en el dinero, ven a buscarme, Nemo
Si estuviera en el club, sabes que hice una bola, quimio
Solté el mixtape, esa mierda sonó como un álbum
¿Quién hubiera pensado que el resultado sería una gira por todo el país?
Las etiquetas quieren mi nombre junto a una X, como Malcolm
Todo el mundo consiguió un trato, lo hice sin uno
Sí, negro, estoy sobre mi negocio
Matando a todos estos raperos, juraría que tenía una lista de objetivos
Todos los que dudaron de mí están pidiendo perdón
Si no has sido parte de esto, al menos tienes que presenciarlo, perras

Puede que no signifique nada para todos ustedes
Pero entiende, no se hizo nada por mi
Así que no planeo detenerme en absoluto
Quiero esta mierda para siempre, melena, siempre, melena, siempre, melena
Estoy cerrando mierda en el centro comercial
Y diciéndole a cada chica que ella es la única para mí
Y ni siquiera estoy planeando llamar
Quiero esta mierda para siempre, melena, siempre, melena, siempre, melena

Siempre-siempre, Mr. West está en el edificio
No hay duda de quién está a punto de matarlos
Solía ​​tener sueños de campana, grandes falsificaciones, grandes cadenas
Metí mi polla dentro de esta vida hasta que llegó esa perra
Y fue duro, todos cayeron como los equipos de pelota
Solo para poder hacer que llueva toda la primavera
Todos han visto mi historia, mi gloria
Violé el juego cuando era joven, puedes llamarlo legal
Cuando un negro explote, me construirán estatuas
Dinero viejo, Benjamin Button, ""¿Qué?"" nada
Ahora son chicas súper malas dándome lo McLovin
Pensarías que manejaba el mundo como el esposo de Michelle
Pensarías que estos negros me conocen cuando en realidad no lo hacen
Como si estuvieran deprimidos con el viejo yo, no, joder, no lo estabas
Um, eres un maldito perdedor
Ni siquiera ha ido a clase, Bueller
Cambia las placas de los Grammy solo para recuperar a mi abuela
¿Recuerdas que tenía esa cadera mala como una riñonera?
Persiguiendo el estrellato te convertirá en un maníaco
Todo el camino en Hollywood y ni siquiera puedo actuar
Sacan las cámaras y maldita sea, chasquea
Solía ​​querer esto para siempre, todos pueden recuperarlo

Y ni siquiera estoy planeando llamar
Quiero esta mierda para siempre, melena, siempre, melena, siempre, melena

Ok, hola, es el marciano, Jordan de Space Jam
Quiero esta mierda para siempre, despierta y huele el jardín
Más fresco que la cosecha, da un paso hacia el objetivo
Si tuviera una suposición, entonces supongo que solo soy de Nueva Orleans
Y nunca me detendré como si estuviera huyendo de la policía
Sube a mi auto y le dije a mi chofer: ""Hasta la cima""
La vida es una maldita montaña rusa, luego cae
Pero, ¿por qué debería gritar? Este es mi parque temático
Mi mente brilla incluso cuando mis pensamientos parecen oscuros
Pistola de mi lado, no quieres escuchar a esa cosa hablar
Deja que el rey hable, mira el precio y presta atención
Lil Wayne, eso es lo que tienen que decir o mencionar
Soy como nevada en medio del verano
Estoy descansando a la cabeza, necesito una almohada y una funda
Shhh, mi pie está durmiendo en el gas
No hay pastillas de freno, no hay nada como lo último, uh

Ahí van, empacando estadios mientras Shady escupe su ritmo
Se vuelven locas, Macadamian, se vuelven tan balísticos, wow
Él puede hacer que parezcan tontos
Se pregunta si debería escupir así de lento, mierda, no
Anda a por todas, su copa simplemente se derrama, oh no
Él no le ha tenido un zumbido como este
Desde la última vez que tuvo una sobredosis
Estaban esperando pacientemente a que Pinocho metiera la nariz
De vuelta al juego y ellos lo saben
El rap nunca volverá a ser el mismo que antes
Sentimientos en el cerebro de estas putas
Y estableciendo un nombre a medida que avanza
La pasión en la llama se enciende
No puedes apagarlo una vez que lo encendemos
Esta mierda es exactamente lo jodido
De que estoy hablando cuando nos rebelamos
Estás lidiando con algunos verdaderos villanos
Que están dentro de una cabina, derramando la verdad
Y escupiendo sentimientos verdaderos hasta que nuestros empastes dentales
Vayan volando de nuestras bocas, ahora, repitelo
Venganza, hijo de puta
Por la forma en que dudaste de mí, ¿a qué sabe?
Cuando saco el sabor de tu boca
Con el bajo tan fuerte que sacude el lugar
Soy Hannibal Lecter, así que en caso de que estés pensando en salvar su cara
No vas a tener rostro que salvar
Para cuando termine con este lugar, entonces Drake

Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

He said ""I fought two wars
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""

We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
Said ""These damn things will kill me yet""

But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh, but me
I'm doing well

And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack
Right there on his grave
And I said

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy","country, billy currington, modern country, country pop, My Country"
93,94,"""Whatever It Is""",Zac Brown Band,"15 ContributorsWhatever It Is Lyrics
She got eyes that cut you like a knife
And her lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
And when she walks in the room, I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile, knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever wanna stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people ask me what it is, tell 'em I don't know
There's just something 'bout the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

'Cause when she loves me, girl, that's how I feel
'Cause when she loves me, I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me, know I can live forever
And when she loves me, I am untouchable

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out ""I love you"", I do
You got whatever it is
Oh, you got whatever it is","country, modern country, zac brown band, Southern Country, Love"

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
""Perfect"" couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so, I
Love you enough to let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

Am I supposed to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act
And you don't know where your life is going? (Oh)
Am I supposed to be torn apart
Broken-hearted in a corner crying?
Pardon me if I don't show it (Oh)

I don't care if I never see you again (No, no)
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and
Get yourself together
But either way, baby, I'm gone

I'm so over it
I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and
Just in case you're wondering

I know you like the long 'do
Had to switch my attitude up (Oh)
Thinking of changing up how I ride
No more on the passenger's side
Too bad you missed out on the way that I drive it

(Ooh) I don't care if I never see you again (No, no)
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and
Get yourself together

Ether boy! Hey!

How we ball in the club, I know you hate it
Mami dancin' on the floor all like she naked
When she laid out with you, I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
Oh ohh! Pop champagne!
Oh ohh! Pop champagne!
Oh ohh! We pop champagne!
Oh ohh! We pop champagne!

We need more bottles, tell ma hurry up
Tell 'em Ron Browz here, hottest in America
Gimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up
Know it's me when you see this fur in your area
And she call me all night cause you can't get it up
On my neck, on my wrist, everything is litted up
Drinkin bottles of that Clicquot 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up (Hey)
If you in the things I'm in
Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance

When I go to the dealer you know I cop that (What's that?)
Brand new 'rarri and the roof drop back (The 60)
Came through Harlem like the Rooftop back (AIYYO!!!)
Money in the bank, man, you know don't stop that (Stop that, stop that, stop that)
(OHHH!) Now we tryin to get up in the club
(OHHH!) Try to tell me no cause I'm rollin with the thugs
(We got money bitch!) Until I flash a couple of dollars (Yep!)
Tell 'em we only want tables and we buyin' out the bottles
(OHHH!) Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Roses and a few cold waters (Right!)
Only Petron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standin' on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was ballin' hard, it was just the ninth inning (It's early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get it in the freak way
SHIT! We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars, no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stoppin' at the light

How we ball in the club, I know you hate it
Mami dancin' on the floor all like she naked
When she laid out with you, I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
Oh ohh! Pop champagne!
Oh ohh! Pop champagne!
Oh ohh! We pop champagne!
Oh ohh! We pop champagne!

Baby I wanna see you work (Go) See you dance (Go)
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mommy got a body see that damn thing move
But, it's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby, I break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you, she lyin, but she fake it
When she with me, she like it, she never fake it

I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance

How we ball in the club, I know you hate it
Mami dancin' on the floor all like she naked
When she laid out with you, I know she fake it

98,99,"""Pretty Wings""",Maxwell,"36 ContributorsPretty Wings (Uncut) LyricsIn this song, Maxwell warns us about relationships in which feelings are somewhat forced rather than occurring naturally.
Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me
Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same
Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free
Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

(If I can't have you, let love set you
Free to fly your pretty wings around)
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around

I came wrong, you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby, believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep 'til I died a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times, better days
And I miss you more and more

If I can't have you, let love set you
Free to fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings your
(Pretty wings, your pretty wings around)
So pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Say pretty wings, oh pretty wings, yeah
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around

Someone better's gonna love you!

Someone! Someone's gonna love you, baby

Rather do without and just hold the smile

Far as the eye can see under your command

I'll steady your hand

Younger now than we were before
