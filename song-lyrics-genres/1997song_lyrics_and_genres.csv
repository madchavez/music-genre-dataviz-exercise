Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything, man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit up, this shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you, B.I.G. 
Can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again

Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

It seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (I miss you, B.I.G.)

It's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)
Know you in Heaven, smilin' down (Ha)
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (Somebody tell me why)

One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take (Every day that passes is a day that I get closer)
Every move I make, every single day (To seeing you again)
Every night I pray, every step I take (We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop 'cause we can't stop)
Every move I make, every single day (That's right)
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day (We miss you, B.I.G)

Now it's Sean on the hot track, melt like it's hot wax
Put it out, all the stores, bet you could shop that (That's right)
Leave a nigga with a hot hat
Fronting like Bad Boy ain't got tracks, nigga, stop that
There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nickel-nine nigga, floss, you die quicker (Uh-huh)
Did fed time, out-of-town pie-flipper
Turn Cristal into a crooked-I-sipper
Everybody want to be fast, see the cash
Fuck around, they weak staff get a heat rash
Anything in Bad Boy way, we smash (We smash)
Hundred-G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (Ahaha)
I'm through with bein a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her

Mase, can you please stop smoking la-la?
Puff, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
I be out in Jersey, puffin' Hershey
Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby
No, I'm never drug-free when I'm the club, G
Though I know the thugs be wantin' to slug me (Uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smooth as Bugsy? (Yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (Come on)
Yo, I think it must be the girls wanna lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me?
Brothers wanna, rock my Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (Ugh)
I'm like, ""Damn, how these niggas got that trif'?
Used to be my man, how he gonna plot on my wife?""
Do you think he snake me 'cause he hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D., ""Player Hatin' Degree"" (Ahaha)

Can't nobody hold me down
Oh, no

Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (Ahaha)

And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (Who?)
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)

And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

There's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly (Woo)

See, I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho-oh

If I can see it (Woo)
Then I can be it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it

I believe I can fly

I think about it every night and day

More than just friends

I'd pretend I was you

Whoa-oh, yes

When you're feelin' lost in the night
When you feel your world just ain't right
Call on me, I will be waitin'
Count on me, I will be there
Anytime the times get too tough
Anytime your best ain't enough
I'll be the one to make it better
I'll be there to protect you
See you through
I'll be there and there is nothing I won't do

I will go and bring you the moon
I will be your hero, your strength
Anything you need
I will be the sun in your sky
I will light your way for all time
I promise you
For you I will (Yes)

I will shield your heart from the rain
I will let no harm come your way
Oh, these arms will be your shelter
No, these arms won't let you down
If there is a mountain to move
I will move that mountain for you
I'm here for you, I'm here forever
I will be your fortress, tall and strong
I'll keep you safe, I'll stand beside you, right or wrong

I will cross the ocean for you (I will cross the ocean)

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Usher talked about the relationship issues that led to this song’s concept:
‘I… Read More 
This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me (Make me, you're makin' me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, babe)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Oh yeah)
You make me, you make me

Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm fallin' for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go (Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it while all of this is goin' on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)

(Hey) You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Oh)
(Oh, you make, make, make me)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Ooh, oh, babe)
You make me wanna (Go on, babe, do your thing)
You make me wanna (Ooh, ooh-ooh yeah)
(Come along wit' it, you're makin' me, you're makin' me)

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)

I hate the world today
You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see the softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way","female vocalists, rock, pop, singer-songwriter, alternative"

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she living, she golden
She lives for me, says she lives for the ovation
Her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I'll make you smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give 'em the games she play, she say

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there to
The place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly face down on the mattress
One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still, it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, heavy on the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

When I was young, I knew everything
And she, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin', with my head on the floor
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

Can't be held responsible
'Cause was touching her face
I won't be held responsible

What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin', with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said

And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place""

Anytime I need to see your face, I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola

And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I would die to find out

I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But a look, then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor and I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking, using symbols, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat

Well, come stand a little bit closer (Oh-oh)
Breathe in and get a bit higher (Oh-oh)
You'll never know what hit you (Oh-oh)

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, girl)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Oh, yeah)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, babe)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (No diggity, no doubt, baby)

I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
My life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow (I imagine)
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe (When spring)
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of (Oh, I)
The scent of your perfume (I imagine when summer burns)
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you (Ooh)
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do (When autumn sheds)
When autumn sheds, the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

Remember
The nights when (Remember the night)
We closed our eyes (When we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

Every time I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional (I get so emotional)
Until you release me, I'm bound under ball and chain (Release me)

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe (Under mistletoe)
When springtime makes its way here

The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

This loneliness has crushed my heart (It's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain (Oh, yeah)
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

Take shelter on my front porch

Would you like a glass of cold lemonade?

I will do the laundry

Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

Kick back and watch the TV
And I'll fix a little something to eat

From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee, my sweet?

And how he always makes your heart skip a beat
Every time he walks by
And if you're feeling down
He'll pick you up
He'll hold you close when you're makin' love
He's everything you've been dreaming of

Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive (oh hoh hoh)

You probably spend hours on the phone
Talkin' 'bout nothing at all (talkin' 'bout nothing at all)
It doesn't matter what the conversation
Just as long as he calls (ohhhhh)
Lost in a love so real
And so sincere
And you wipe away each other's tears (all of those tears)
Your face lights up whenever he appears

The song is basically a jab at all the rappers who we’re stealing Bone’s style at the time.
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

Comin' through the door with my militia, why do they bring big niggas?
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas
Steppin' out the limos the bitch soldiers maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang, you know me. Homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence
Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me his roll or loco, sober, load a revolver, hold up
Now, buck 'em all to Hell, cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bulletholes was too much, no luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original?
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin'
Years ago
And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that
But a y'all fin to get stomped, let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh-huh, hey, we murder muthafuckas in a deadly way -
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay
""Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface.""
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest
What a bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster, givin' you the most
I toast to them thugs
Nigga, nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table
And a nigga wanna test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga
And it's war when you craft these Bones we can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches
Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since '93, shuttin'
Shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that?
I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros, and make friend of foes
But we chosen - God done blessed us with His potion
Pure devotion, freely spoken, baby
Niggas can't see us never, stay together, my clique too clever
Ridin' through the days of the stormy weather
Remember: eternal, it means for everlastin'
#1 Assassin blastin', bashin' on all you niggas's what I'm doin'
All of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues, when He come
We won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong

Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

I see five killer realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go
True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river
We the killers, and that's for sure
Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine
And when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double-time
And it's like that, you don't want that
Come and get some pap, pap. Wanna sound like?
Wanna be like? Nigga, we can't have that
Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit? Platinum raps
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin'
Outta nothin'
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the 44 mag, I'm glad
Cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a body bag
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killer thug puttin' it down with
Harmony, harmony

There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this

That it's all coming back to me

And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever (Forever)
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

I finally found someone
Who knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one
Who makes me feel complete
It started over coffee
We started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things
The best things begin
This time is different la la la la
It's all because of you la la la la
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause we can talk it through
My favorite line
Was ""Can I call you sometime?""
It's all you had to say
To take my breath away

This is it
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do it's just got to be you
My life has just begun, I finally found someone
Ooooh, someone
I finally found someone
Ooooh

Did I keep you waiting? I didn't mind
I apologize Baby, that's fine
I would wait forever
Just to know you were mine
You know, I love your hair Are you sure it looks right?
I love what you wear Isn't it too tight?
You're exceptional
I can't wait for the rest of my life

A long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
We went searchin'
Through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down
Real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well, who hasn't been there before?
I come 'round
Around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

Well, okay, I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

Far away from here

And everywhere in-between

To fall in love is so hard to do
I hope and pray tonight
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl

You see your world inside her eyes

You know she's standing by your side

It's enough to make you cry
When you see her walking by
And you look into her eyes

I cut with razor blades, play spades with Aunt Venus
Evaluate this rap, take heed a fuckin' genius
Up in the sky, up high don't puff lah
Do you smoke crack Sam, prepare to fuckin' die
Fuck Crazy Joe, my name is Crazy Flow
You thought I had eight but I got ten mo'
Off beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street
I stink like Pop's feet, make sweat with no heat

I'm up on this track, like Pam Grier in movies
I heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi
I fly to L.A., then come back to Virginia
Then call Maganoo to see if he's got some indo
Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, G
G don't forget to bring the house keys
Hops in the eight, five-oh now here we go
Please, please brother don't slam my car door

I need all my money to pay my bills with
Don't have no time for the shucking and jiving
Peep my rhyme cause that shit's off-timing

After I smoke pot, he sticks me like shots
Funky like farts, connect tongues like dots
Lick his lollipop, this kid named Scott

Touch my hot spot, I scream til I can't stop, uhh

He was high on intellectualism

So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
(Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house)

Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I


Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks, from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I


Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done

Just tell me what you've got to say to me
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise at all, you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now I know your heart, I know your mind
You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way

Well, I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

When I saw my best friend yesterday
She said she never liked you from the start
Well, me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes? I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way?

Well, I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

Well, I guess what they say is true

Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinking
And smoking, pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy? 'Cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
'Cause my crew is rolling Hummers and your crew is rolling dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it go
I ain't tryna preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'ma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waiting with the sounds bumping

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin, for your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryna stack
And keep up with the Jones's takin advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right when there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we got to put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You got to face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there","rap, Hip-Hop, 90s, hip hop, West Coast Rap"

Last night, you were so into it
You told me secrets that, you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and, yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine, as you taste mine
I kissed your lips, you felt my body slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night (Last night)
I was inside of you (Inside of you)
Last night (Last night)
While making love to you (While making love to you)
I saw the sun (The sun), the moon (The moon), the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and, so very innocent
We talked of memories, our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night, right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight, in your soul
You felt incredible, I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night (Last night)
I was inside of you (Inside of you)
Last night (Last night)
While making love to you (While making love to you)
I saw the sun (The sun), the moon (The moon), the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Sunlight, red red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so, I'm so in love

Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that
Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up Yeah

Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back, in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions, while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve – just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard, we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now

Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)
What you lookin' all sad for?
Nigga, you Black, smile for me now
Smile for me
Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about
Won't you smile? No doubt, smile for me now
Just smile (And the next generation)

Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life, came to dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy, hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality, we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football, chose to cook raw, wouldn't take, but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile

Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

Fuck the world, as we unloading, witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the Feds, in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is ""Fuck friends"" – we military-minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me – lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed, hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga

And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine upon your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say these prayers for the homie 'Pac

If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price, she'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

She'll let you in her car
To go driving 'round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in her heart if you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget?

She'll lead you down the path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there

Then she'll look at you and smile
And her eyes'll say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need will always stay
A million miles away","rock, classic rock, singer-songwriter, folk, 80s"

Hey, oh

How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me, so I can understand

How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away?

Say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to just tell me lies?

Break this heart of mine, tell me

How could you be so cold to me?
When I gave you everything
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?

How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me?

Bring such misery?

Wearing nothing is divine
Naked is a state of mind
I take things off to clear my head
To say the things I haven't said
Live inside the elements
The earth and sky are my best friends
Water is the evidence
That washes me from end to end

With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all
If I said it all, I could see

It's not a choice I tried to make
It's not a thought I couldn't take
Something told me it was time
To give you yours and leave me mine
My vision started to be clear
I watched the sunlight coming near
I knew the day I knew the night
I knew I could regain my sight

And it feels alright
And it feels alright

Last night I came into your home
To break some ice and throw some stones
I asked if we could be alone
I had some troubles of my own
Knew I had to say goodbye
To all the old things held inside
If I let the moment fly
I knew they'd all be magnified

And it feels alright
And it feels alright

Came around after dark
You are nothing but a lark
Know I snuck in like a narc
I knew I had to leave my mark
Wanted to be satisfied
I tried to be dignified

I have often dreamed of a far-off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying, ""This is where I'm meant to be.""

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way, if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope
'Til I go the distance and my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Til I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms

I will search the world, I will face its harms
'Til I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms","pop, soft rock, soul, male vocalists, rock"
