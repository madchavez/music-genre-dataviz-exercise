0,1,"""Gangsta's Paradise""",Coolio featuring L.V.,"1 ContributorRap Critic Reviews: “Gangsta’s Paradise” by Coolio ft. L.V. LyricsHi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:
*show ODB with hair*
You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:
""Fantastic Voyage""
Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood
Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by
And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned
*video starts*
You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:
""You wanna tell me what this is all about""

Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint

*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down
Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!
This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…
Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool. I didn't feel like he enjoyed any of this. I felt like he hated this lifestyle, he hated himself, and he hated the world that put him here. This song is a lament, it is a dark evaluation of what was going on in the heart of Hiphop, and it was needed in pop culture, and… hey, this song was also parodied by Weird Al… I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose...","rap, Hip-Hop, 90s, hip hop, West Coast Rap"

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter, listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation, but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place, y'all don't hear me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray?
I pray all ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (I know, I know, your way, hey)
But I think you're moving too fast","rnb, Hip-Hop, female vocalists, pop, soul"

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

I'm gonna swallow my pride, say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life, and I want it with you
If you feel the same, don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things, it won't hurt anymore
No, I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back

Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watchin' you, watchin' me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say goodbye
Say goodbye (Bye-bye)
Say goodbye

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breakin' my heart
(Breakin' my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say goodbye
Say goodbye (Bye-bye)
Say goodbye

All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart?

I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say goodbye
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)

It's just one of dem days when I wanna be all alone

It's just one of dem days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone, and you think I treat you wrong

I wanna take some time out to think things through
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong
But I'm so in love with you
So understand that I'm only in love

Hey now, I really wanna be with you the whole way through
'Cause the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused
As I swing back mood to mood, it's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure
So won't you understand that I'm only in love?

I'll be there for you when you need me, boy

It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by

So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway

And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say ""I love you"" no more

And some just don't know how to change

We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Now, now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
'Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other?
Why do we push love away?

Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry

Oh, once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there, I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's callin' for the movie rights
Singing, ""Hey, babe, let's keep in touch
Hey, baby, let's keep in touch""
But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround?

Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full
Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well, all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround?

Sun and fun in the atmosphere, oh, yes

In the summertime, when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women, you've got women on your mind

See now what I can find
Now if her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor, then do as you feel
Speedin' down the lane even though the speed limit's twenty-five
And when the sun goes down, I'll make it with my cutie pie

Weh me say pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey, sting like bumble bee
Shaggy say pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as honey, sting like bumble bee
It's a summertime affair in the atmosphere
I man love off her attire and the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tire and a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up, not a sign of snare
Got to be rolling in my Christas, so the girls them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon as your ultimate pair
Taking care of our career, so tell the world beware
'Cause it's a brand new selection for your musical ear

'Cause we say what we want and we say what we need
And we love everybody, and we do as we please
And when the weather is fine
We go fishin', we go fishin' in the sea
We are happy
To live life, that's our philosophy
Now if her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor, just do as you feel
Speedin' down the lane even ehough the speed limit's twenty-five
And when the sun goes down, I'll make it with my cutie pie

Sweat a-run off her body with her caramel skin
I man smiled at her, she looked at me and gave me a grin
I offered her a drink, and she said juice and Gin
And I whispered in her ear, I asked, ""How you doin'?""
Where was it that I reside, and I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance, eyes were sparkling
Just her voice and what she said, ""Let my poor head spin""
Raggamuffin Shaggy now with a musical swing
I say pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey, sting like bumble bee
Shaggy say pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as honey, sting like bumble bee

In the summertime, when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women, you've got women on your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride and
See now what I can find
Now if her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor, then do as you feel
Speedin' down the lane even though the speed limit is twenty-five
And when the sun goes down, I'll make it with my cutie pie

Pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey, sting like bumble bee
I said pretty little women, sexy as can be
Sweet as honey, sting like bumble bee
It's a summertime affair in the atmosphere
I man love off her attire and the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tire and a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up, not a sign of snare
Got to be rolling in my Christas, so the girls them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon as your ultimate pair
Taking care of our career, so tell the world beware
'Cause it's a brand new selection for your musical ear

Oh, oh, ooohhhh
Oh, oh, ooohhhh

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming around
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Oh, oh, ooohhhh

(Turn around)
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be
(Turn around)
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
(Turn around)
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wonderous as you
(Turn around)
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better; there's nothing that I just wouldn't do

Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say

But now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself ""How did love slip away?""
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Excuse me
There we go

I've seen the world, been to many places
Made lots of friends, many different races
I've had such fun around the world it's true
African skies with a Nairobi mood
I fell asleep in Tuscany and dreamed
The one thing missing was you

Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines
Oh, under the moon glow, down in Mexico
I dreamed, one thing was missing that's you

Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

We'll sail the waters of many colors
Won't need no compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
I want to share the world with you, you see
Springtime in Paris feels so good to me
Oh, this is for me reality, so please
Make all my wishes come true

Runaway with me, my love

Nothing's true and nothing's right

You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we're all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down
Then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind

All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all colors of the wind","pop, rnb, female vocalists, soul, 80s"

Well, there's nothing I can do

I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare

You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it

You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go

You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart

Creep on in, on in, on in
Woah
See, I'm ridin' high, woah
Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got is five, I got five

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like the cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
And when it comes to getting another stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi (Shinobi)
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit Bit
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
'Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb, da-dumb-dumb
I come to school (Nyoom) with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoidin' all the dick teasers, skeezers and weirdos
That be blowin' off the land like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more growin' pains than Maggie
'Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed
'Cause I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
'Cause I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
'Cause I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

I take sacks to the face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow, so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (Hahahaha)
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell, no! You better bring your own spliff, chief (Five on it)
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint
Stop hittin' 'cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
'Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my PO
I know I failed 'cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me

I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your '40, let's get keyed

Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thang got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashishs
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low-budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land gettin' smoked with my kinfolk, Ibeen smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down
Up in the O-A-K, the Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja (Wouh)

Don't you wish you had the same?

Please, baby, can't you see
My mind's a burnin' hell
I got razors a-rippin' and tearin' and strippin'
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for somethin' new
And some other woman is lookin' like somethin'
That might be good for you

Go on and hold her 'til the screamin' is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across a fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please, baby, can't you see
I'm tryin' to explain
I've been here before and I'm lockin' the door
And I'm not goin' back again
Her eyes and arms and skin
Won't make it go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

Go on and hold her 'til the screamin' is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across a fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone

Go on and hold her 'til the screamin' is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across a fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone

Who'll drown in my desire for you

I don't wanna see you ever sad
Everything that I've got, you can have
When it's all too much, you need some human touch
To see it's really not so bad

Did you call on every saint you know
But still you feel like you're on your own?
Can you see through your tears I will always be here
And you're not out there, baby, all alone?

Hold on, 'til you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me, yeah, and I said
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right
Just hold on to me tonight

Anything that hurts you hurts me, too
And I'm not gonna let your world turn blue
Will you take my hand and feel how close I am?
There ain't nothin' I won't do for you, come on, now

Hold on, 'til you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me, yeah, and I said
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right
Just hold on to me tonight

I know the world can drive you to your knees
But when you need to cry, baby, cry to me, yeah

Funk you right on up
So get up, get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin' it real enables me to make another mill,
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick

So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to 'cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you God damn right I'ma gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted

So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top

Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true...
Hello?

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me
But, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go
And even in my dreams
I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball,
So how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their man ball
Dag, y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls
And me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, sca-bobble""
Got hit with a bottle
And put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box
And nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcometh by thoughts
Of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'ma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive!""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle
And these girls keep Passin' Me By
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
Wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
Wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

I wish I was a baller (Wish I was a baller)

I wish I was a baller (Yeah)

Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday,
And you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names:

Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck
Then you should know just how I feel

See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound

Families together kill someone

On a traffic island stopped
And he raved of saving me

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club, either
This is L.A. 

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me, out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Lettin' each one burn, down to his thick fingers
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun

Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time to slang
Bang and watch all the poo-tang tangs hang

Here we go, now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow

Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
Then beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully, chase bass-lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party?
It's 'nuff poo-tang tang for everybody!
So hip up and split up, get up, get up your with up
Souped up, put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not, zip up your lip up
Whip up hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones
We came back 'cause we heard hip-hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Repin' these since the '70s, find me
So we went crazy in the '80s
So we won't kiss heinies in the '90s
Oops, the Naughty's, troops in sections with forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty, I'm Naughty

Here we go
Now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if you hear me though
Come and feel me flow

You and I
In this moment
Holding the night so close
Hanging on
Still unbroken
While outside the thunder rolls

Listen now
You can hear our heartbeat
Warm against life's bitter cold
These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

There are times that scare me
Were rattle the house like a wind
Both of ours so unbending
We battle the fear within

All the while
Life is rushing by us
Hold it now and don't let go
These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

So we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness
Watching the stars
Till they're gone
And then even the memories have all faded away
These days go on and on

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)

At times, I window-watch out the Marriott
Zonin' on ownin' co-ops, foreign drop-top coupes and yachts
Guzzlin' straight shots of scotch
Formulatin' up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot 'cause it's scorchin' hot
Makin' it hard tryin' to figure who's out to trap me — Pataki
Got all kinds of undercovers that's comin' at me
Perhaps he won't be happy 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be, sittin' in Coxsackie
But never me, see, my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstasy, on a hill that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)

A-yo, son, pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the Grants in the safe, 'cause we spendin' the Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how we do

No more cuttin' grams and wrappin' grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seekin' for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old-timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer, and enjoy how life's supposed to treat ya
Laid in the shades of the Everglades, finally forever paid
Wearin' the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Caribbean cuisines
I guess bein' down for so long, I'm all in-store to see my dreams

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)

So until I see past the green pasture
Me bein' supreme master, ain't much more of life I fiend after
But another chapter, a new way of life to adapt to
'Cause these streets'll gas ya, and have ya caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killer crew more hospitable
Consciously aware, plus political (Political)
'Cause though they claim every man's created equal
Us as native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established, we eatin' lovely, livin' lavish
Like the House of Versailles in Paris, I gotta have this
It's so plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real

It's so crazy, I'm down with AZ
It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly
It's so crazy, Jones and AZ
It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly (Woooooo!!)

Looking around the house
Hidden behind the window and the door
Searching for signs of life
But there's nobody home
Well, maybe I'm just too sure
Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it
Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said

Aha, it was good, living with you
Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Aha, it was good, living with you
Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah
Good, good, good, good, good, good

Sitting around the house
Watching the sun trace the shadows on the floor
Searching for signs of life
But there's nobody home
Well, maybe I'll call or I'll write you a letter
Now maybe we'll see on the fourth of July
But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud
Well I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud to say

Aha, it was good, living with you

I was in love with you
I gave my heart to you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you
You said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done to make you be so rough

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

Girl I was there for you
Someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breaking my heart?
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel?
I don't understand why you've been so wrong

I tried to be your strength
You said I was too strong
I tried to compromise
So we could get along
I gave my love to you
Despite your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me, there's only one thing left to say

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

There's a time when you know what you feel inside your heart
It's telling you that something is strange
Ooh girl, you don't have to deny it
All you got to do is just try it
You'll find our love is stronger if you're willing to change

And I thank you (Thank you)

All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing everywhere I go
Things you taught me, they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sure 'nough wouldn't have survived without you, you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me, oh

'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)

Da-da, da-dap
Da-ah, da
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Da-da, da-dap
Da-ah, da, da-dap
Ba-dap, da-dap

'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (Thank you)
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there

If you ain't heard of me, take a seat, lay back and listen
As I bust for your ass on this funkdafied mission
Just kick off your shoes and relax your feet (That's right)
Party on down with Da Brat and her beat
Now it goes like that and that's how it goes
I'ma give it to all you negroes and hoes
So listen up, make sure you listen up well
And don't miss shit 'cause this bitch be bad as hell
Truth of matter is I splatter kids that talk shit
In a gangsta's way, that's how them fools get dealt with
So want you wanna do, bitch? Don't even trip
Step up, step up and I'ma bust your lip
Now I know that you know that I know you don't want me to

Devastating, captivating, elevating as I
Smooth operating and I love to get high
Well, nigga, fire up (Say what?), nigga, fire it up
At your request I guess it's time for me to get fucked up
It goes one puff, two puff, three puff, four
From the bottom to the top, top to bottom I go
So now you know, what I ain't and what I is
It's the baddest new bitch in this hip-hop biz
O.G. Is what I am, a brat is what I be
Blunts are what I smoke and you can't see me
So let it go, 'cause my shit is tight
Take it how it give it and enjoy the night

Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see

Put me out of my misery

We will always be busy making misery

We could build a factory and make misery
We'll create the cure, we made the disease

Was it only envy? So empty

There's a time and place for everything, for everyone
We can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come
Oh no, nothing's gonna change
And if I asked you not to try, oh, could you let it be?

I wanna hold you and say
We can't throw this all away
Tell me you won't go, you won't go
Do you have to hear me say

I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you

You can change your friends, your place in life
You can change your mind
We can change the things we say
And do it anytime
Oh no, but I think you'll find
That when you look inside your heart
Oh, baby, I'll be there, yeah

Hold on
I'm holding on
Baby, just come on, come on, come on
I just wanna hear you say

I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what you say or do
You know my heart is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you

Oh, I'm so twisted and tied
And all I remember
Was how hard we tried
Only to surrender

And when it's over
I know how it's gonna be
And true love will never die
No, not fade away

And I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you
And I know what I got to do
Hey Ray, what you said is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you, oh
