Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe

You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh, baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinkin' 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope he shows up in a 2 AM pic from a friend
Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then he calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope he comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope he spends his last dime to put a rock on your hand
I hope he's wilder than your wildest dreams
He's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope he cheats

I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy (Oh woah, oh)

Tornato con il remix
Questi ragazzi tutti miei figli come Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
La mia città e il mio stato non hanno mai visto questo
Jimmy Neutron, sono un ragazzo prodigio (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Sul futon, le sto dando quel cazzo
Quando questa merda è pronta, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, come Gilbert Arenas, sparo il colpo
Sono ancora con i demoni, ooh, I keep it thorough
Ho cinque tipe a New York
Questo significa una in ogni quartiere
Sono nel pocket come Burrow
Quando sono tornato a casa, though
Mi trattano come Robert De Niro
La ho portata Taco Bell, le ho comprato un churro
La ho portata a casa, le ho dato un cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeri su zeri su zeri (Zeri)
Quello è cosa il bilancio del mio conto bancario dice (Woo)
Ho a check dalla compagnia di scarpe
Ora faccio qualsiasi cosa che dice New Balance
Le ho comprato un biglietto aereo, fuori di stato
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Ho detto, ""Sono in città oggi""
Lei ha detto che she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' quella merda
Così quando she pull up on me so cosa she 'bout to say

Come butta?
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
Ho delle opzioni
Potrei passare quella puttana come Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin' (Oh, these niggas got me fucked up, nigga)
Sto facendo questa vacanza chiuso dentro (Ooh, you know, it's like)
Il mio corpo got rid of them toxins (Let me go, mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top dieci

Chiama la mia puttana, dille, ""Prendimi that noggin"" (Brrt)
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Chiamami DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
Sono un vero creativo and stylish, F&N nel mio denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back da L.A. sul jet ieri (Nyoom)
I go back and forth come se giocassi a tennis
Fotto con la tua puttana, yeah, I'm fit for it
Ancora su Billboard, la canzone numero uno nel Regno Unito
And I done got so fuckin' rich, tutte queste puttane sul mio cazzo
Non mi frega ancora un cazzo di cosa mi dicono
Lei lo mangia come Pac-Man, negro (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga come se fossi Batman, negro (Eat it)
I just pulled up nella Batmobile (Nyoom)
La ragione per cui non fotto con questi rap-ass negri
Perché loro sono cap-ass negri (Cap)
E il loro rap non è vero (Cap)
Credimi, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, bisogno di un Squeegee
These niggas watered down, loro bevono Fiji
La mia auto è arancione e marrone come se fossi a Cleveland
La mia puttana è Mello Yello come una soda (Soda)
Questi negri tattletalers, io sono un soldato
Ayy, qualcuno dica a questi negri che è finita
Tu sai è Baby, negro

Come butta? (Poppin')
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Woo, hahaha)
Ho delle opzioni (Ayy)
Potrei passare quella puttana come Stockton (Uh)

Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
Lei mi chiama papi, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler in case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself

'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know

Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?

I know you got a roster just full of hittas
But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers
Been through so much shit that you don't even know the difference
Made so many mental notes that you can't save a picture
Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad

Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'

Good girl, turned her into a savage

Low-key, I've been keeping it classy

She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions

I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit

No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama

Sí, no me quiero quedar dormido, no me quiero desmayar
Estuve pensando en nuestro futuro porque nunca veré esos días
No sé por qué esto ha sucedido, pero probablemente me lo merezco
Intenté dar lo mejor de mí, pero sabes que no soy perfecto
He estado orando por el perdón, tú has estado orando por mi salud
Cuando me vaya de esta tierra, esperando que encuentres a alguien más
Porque sí, seguimos siendo jóvenes, hay mucho que no hemos hecho
Casarse, formar una familia, mirar a tu esposo con su hijo
Ojalá pudiera ser yo, pero no saldré de esta cama
Espero ir al cielo así podré verte una vez más
Mi vida fue algo corta, pero tuve tantas bendiciones
Feliz de que fueras mía, apesta que todo esté terminando

No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama (Sí, ey)
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama (Ey, sí)

Estoy feliz de que estés conmigo, perdón si lagrimeo
Cuando tú y yo éramos jóvenes, siempre me animarías
Filmando videos bobos y caminando por del parque
Saltarías en mis brazos al escuchar un ladrido
Nos acurrucaríamos en tus sábanas, me cantarías dormida
Y nos escaparíamos por tu cocina exactamente a las 1:03
Domingos, íbamos a misa, los lunes, mirábamos una película
Pronto estarás sola, perdón por perderme

No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama

No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama

Ne istiyorsun ? Dediğimi tekrarlamayacağım
Gece gelen bir hırsızım (Gece olunca hırsızım)

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Sana bebeğim dersem, sadece bir günlüğüne öylesindir
Veya sadece bir geceliğine, sen benim karım olamazsın
Bütün gece sevişmek için bir katil arıyor
Ben ise bir fahişe, tüm gece sakso çeksin bana
Saatim AP, büyük parçacıklı, ekibimle birlikte mahallemdeyim
5.000 harcadım akşam yemeğine, bir 300 de sen ateşle torbacıya

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Zenginim ama sürüyorum, alışmakta sıkıntı çekiyorum, Öfkelenip daha fazlasını kazanmak üzereyim
Böylesini görmemiştim, tonla para üstümde, Yüz binlerim çantamda bu çok tatlı bir iş
Baby OG, koşuşturuyordum bu sokaklarda, Lashawn'dan öğrendim piyasayı, ben annemin oğluyum
Gençken dinim hakkında bir şeyler öğrendim, İşlerin yürümediğini biliyordum ve kaptım elime silahı
Sırf Dior alabilmek için Paris'e gittim
Hatun ilgi için yalvarıyor, siklemiyorum onu
Huzur içinde yat Pop, keşke bizi görebilseydin
Ben ve CashMoney ne zaman gitsem buluşuyoruz
Caddelerde adamlarım gezer, beni yenemezsin
Ben olmaya çalışan bir endüstri var
Ray Charles'a gidiyorum, beni göremiyorlar
RiRi ile Rolls-Royce'dayım

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Geceleri bir hırsız gibi
Uğradım ve ona bu gecelik için D verdim
Arabanın içinde sevişmeye çalışıyor, bu kadar yeter
Koltuklarımın üstünde yapamayız çünkü beyaz renkteler (Bunlar benim koltuklarım orospu çocuğu koltuklarıma bak)
''Thriller'' klibinde gibi yaşıyorum hayatı sadece gece vakti dışarı çıkıyorum
Hatun likör kullanmıyor, içkili olmayı sevmiyor
Hatun Hennesy içmiyor, sadece beyaz şarap
Patlattım Pinot Grigio marka şarabı
Porsche ile yanaşıyorum, yanımda fena bir kaltak
Porshce'u park edip Lambo'ya atlıyorum

Sevimli hatunu sevişmeye zorladım, sevgilisini bıraktı
Ateş etmeyi ve seni sevindirmeyi severim, ben Ramboyum

Huzur içinde yat Pop, ölümün yaktırdı bana bir cigara

Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't wanna look back in 30 years
And wonder who you're married to
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You

All the wasted days, all the wasted nights
I blame it all on being young
Got no regrets 'cause it got me here
But I don't wanna waste another one
I been thinkin' about what I want in my life
It begins and ends the same
If I had to choose what I couldn't lose
There'd only be one thing

Her şeyimle kendim olmaya çalışıyorum
Ama bazen ortaya hiçbir şey çıkmıyor
Her şeyimle kendim olmaya çalışıyorum
Ama bazen ortaya hiçbir şey çıkmıyor
Tanrıya beni daha iyi bir adam yapması için dua ediyorum
Belki bir gün, bir şeyler olması için bekliyorum
Seni planın bir parçası yaptığı için Tanrı'ya teşekkür ediyorum
Sanırım hiçbir şey için cehennemden geçmeyeceğim
Her zaman lanet olası tabuları yıkıyorum, sanki mükemmelleştiriyorum
Sana aşkımı sunuyorum, umarım bir ilaçmış gibi alırsın
Bana benden daha iyi kimsenin olmadığını söyle
Benden daha iyi olduğunu düşünüyorum
Umarım içimde daha iyisini görürsün
Her zaman beni iyileştirirsin

Uyuşturucu alıyoruz sonra beni daha yakınında tutuyorsun
O zaman beni nasıl bütünleştirdiğini söyle bana
Bazen yalnız olmayı sevdiğini hissediyorum
O zaman söyle bana, odada kalmalı mıyım?
Sanırım her şeyi yanlış anladım, benim hatam
Hatalarım muhtemelen yaptığım tüm doğruları siliyor
Geçmişe güle güle de, onlar mazide kaldı
Başın dik olsun, bebeğim güçlü kal, uzun yaşayacağız

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

And I know, you know, we know you weren't

I know, you know, we know we weren't

Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана ""Мозга"" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания

Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить

Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу

В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!

Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...
Чел стой
Смотри что в планах!

Забавно, что трек, вообще не звучит так, как мы только что фристайлили
О, е
Я просто хочу красивых сучек
Самых красивых, те сучки — самые красивые, а, а
Когда я употребляю молли, я жесткий
А, я говорю, а

Мне не нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а
Когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита, а, эй
Мне нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а, эй
Но когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита

Убираю перки и беру экстази, экстази, экстази
Томми в этом Томми Хилфигер, —фигер, —фигер
Этот Томми выстреливает в ниггера, Томми Хилфигер, нахуй ниггеров
Я классный, когда под таблетками, мне она нравится
Я не курю сканк, но этой ночью буду под наркотой, нигга
Наливаю кодеин и добавляю Молли в стакан
Я знаю, что она ёбнутая, ага, ей это понравится
Она — моя липучка, ага, похоже я прилип к ней
Я погружаюсь в нее, будто в воду моряк, мне нравится трахать её
Зависимый от ее личных вещей, мне нужно сказать ей это
Я чувствую это, будто гадалка
Твой бывший ниггер был хорош, но я могу быть лучше
Красивая сучка из леса, думаю, она охотница
Думаю, она убийца и едок, она Джеффри Дамер
Я могу понять, когда она находится в себе, я могу читать её, будто книгу
Нет ни Тека, ни Беретты, ни FN направленного на меня, я правильно понял?
Е, е, е

Мне не нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а
Когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита, а, эй
Мне нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а, эй
Но когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита

Мой бро подметил ее, она красивая сучка, думаю о ней
Она не должна слышать, что я жесткий, однажды заполучив сучку, я начинаю владеть ей
Я знаю, у нее есть стиль, а у меня есть деньги, так что я хочу ее
Видишь эту пушку 4-5 калибра у меня в штанах, наставлю тебе её на заж, зажму на братана
Девчонка, она наездница с Глоком, наставленным на неё
И девчонка, я умру здесь без стояка
Если у нас проблемы, мы избавляемся от
Положил 20 тысяч в твой кошелек, мы собираемся делать деньги
Я являюсь определением бандита
Забрал твое сердце из его рук и до сих пор не говорю всякую грязь
Новые киллеры в моем округе, тебе следует убежать
Это грязная пушка с калибром .38, эта сучка наносит урон
Закидываюсь колёсами, 4K Trey, позвони, когда приземлишься с грузом
Я разрешу тебе заехать к моим бро, где они будут лежать с этим
Я обработал эту сучку, я открываю банку с этим
Нахуй АК-47, я налечу с рукопашкой

Мне не нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а
Когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита, а, эй
Мне нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а, эй
Но когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита",melodic rap; emo rap

This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain

To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?

Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Mama, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart

Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? (Prayin' so hard)
Can you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark)
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?

How does he sleep at night?

It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said I don't love you a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

I hope you find what you were lookin' for
I hope your heart ain't hurtin' anymore
And you get movin' on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warnin'
I thought that I was what you wanted

Well, I guess you found what you were lookin' for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothin' left
And so I hope you're happy now

I hope you find what you were lookin' for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get movin' on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothin' left
So I hope you're happy now

Happy now
Oh, I hope you're happy now

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OGs salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a GOAT, I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

The track comes just days… Read More 
Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here

Она хочет затусить с парнем из Ву
Она хочет затусить с парнем из Ву
Она хочет затусить с парнем из Ву

Я сказал ей, ""Уух-вуу-вуу""
Детка хочет трахнуться прям в тачке
Я могу вывезти тебя хоть куда, нахуй реактивный тариф
Отель Versace на мне Versace халат, воу, воу
Люблю тебя, когда ты распускаешь свои волосы без расчёски
И я остаюсь для себя, потому что я никогда не любил этих шлюх (Да)
И она любит только деньги, красный свет этим шлюхам
Почему я должен тратить своё время на шоути, у которой я не на переднем плане?
Особенно, когда ты получаешь дизайнерскую одежду и я пою вином и угощаю обедом
И Bentley пришёл с крыльями, как номер девять, да
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём

Она может обращаться с собой самостоятельно, ей просто нужен член
Получил эту большую Birkin сумку стоимостью пять, шесть чисел
Ты может был не в своей лиге, ты можешь купить это, нигга? (Купи это)
Я подхожу к её вершине ухожу на рассвете, я дон
Ты можешь валять дурака, если хочешь, если хочешь
На Бали, большие качели, большое платье
Большая жопа, заставляю её сквиртить и делать большую грязь
До того, как мы закончили, она спросила ""Где мы займёмся этим в следующий раз?""
Дальше, так мокро, что испортили сиденья в самолёте
Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо
Сверху вниз, катаюсь вокруг со стволом

Za każdym razem gdy ruchamy nazywa mnie tatusiem
Moja laska jest niegrzeczna
Widzę tą cipkę przez majtki (Co tylko chcesz)
Ona smakuje jak cukierki
Jest królową, jak Nefertiti
Uh oh, moja laska ładnie siedzi
I my idziemy na zakupy przez całe miasto (Oh, oh)
Dałem jej klucze do bentleya (Woah, woah)
Wstań z kolan, nie musisz do mnie płakać
Jestem twoim najlepszym przyjacielem, kochanie, nie musisz kłamać
Dam ci co tylko chcesz i co potrzebujesz od Chanel do Celine
To ty decydujesz
Valentino, tak, daję ci co najlepsze
Zacznij podnosić sukienkę, zaczynam całować twoją szyję (Oh nie, nie)
Zacznę masować ci twój tyłek, zacznę masować ci piersi
Nie chcę jeszcze dać ci dziecka, więc wycofałem się i spuściłem się na twoich piersiach
Wsadziłem cię do Ubera (Ubera) i wysłałem cie do łóżka (Oh)
Następnego dnia (Oh) wysłałaś mi wiadomość (Oh)
Podjechałaś do chaty i zrobiliśmy to ponownie (Oh, oh)

Laska jest niegrzeczna (Ona jest niegrzeczna)

Laska łapie wahania nastroju
Za każdym razem gdy rucham bez gumki
To spuściłem się na pościel
I trzymałem to pod przykrywką
Bo ja nie całuje i opowiadam (Ooh)

Wiesz, nigdy nie znalazłem miłości dopóki nie spojrzałem w twoje oczy (Dopóki nie spojrzałem w twoje oczy)
Pierwszy raz się rumienię, nawet nie będę kłamać (Nawet nie będę kłamać)
Po czterech rundach, zostawiam siniaki na twoich udach
Jesteś jedyną suką która może sprawić że rzucę się na facetów
I jedyna suką która sprawia że chcę się spuścić kiedy jestem w środku
To twój klimat, odejdź ze mną jesteś najarana
Dziewczyno, wszystkie suki są niczym przy tobie nawet gdy próbują
Ona jest tsunami, nigdy nie poczułem jej suchej
Zamykam oczy kiedy śpię, mam nadzieję że będziesz tam kiedy się obudzę
Szczerze mówiąc, czuję że atmosfera którą mamy jest świetna
I jeśli masz cos na myśli, możesz mi powiedzieć
I jeśli powiedział by mi co jest na mojej, czy pomogłabyś mi?
Zobaczysz większy obraz, to po prostu zajmie trochę czasu
Tylko dlatego że jesteś moja, sprawię, że będziesz wyglądać jak diament
Nie ma żadnych niedoskonałości, dziewczyno, jesteś niezła
Kochanie, jaki jest twój znak?
Mam nadzieje że nie jesteś wolna gdy pracujesz
(Praca, praca, to ja i ty) Ja i ty
Bądź cicho, teraz nie ma niczego czego nie możemy zrobić
Przez storm, kochanie, my możemy przez to przejść
Dlaczego zachowujesz się jak nowa? Wiesz że jesteś moją laską, tak
Wstałem na mojego Birkina, to działa
Powiedziała, że jest dziewicą (to boli)
Jest moim największym fanem, ona zawsze jest przyczajona
I wie że jestem mężczyzną, ja na to zapracuję
Wiem, że mnie nie znosi, jestem luksusowy
Więc przyprowadzę ją, kiedy dostanę Grammy
Seks późną nocą, nie może znaleźć swoich majtek
Nie mogła tego wstrzymać, teraz ona potrzebuje planu B
Laska jest niegrzeczna
Laska jest teraz ze mną
I laska ma grubą dupę (Laska ma grubą dupę)

Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep

They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
Ooh

Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
Ooh

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em

It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me

92,93,"""Does to Me""",Luke Combs featuring Eric Church,"17 ContributorsDoes To Me Lyrics
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown

Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in

The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
