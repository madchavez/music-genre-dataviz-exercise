If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Laggy internet that you barely move
And you love dying in murder mystery 2
Now i'm tired of you acting so confused

Przytulamy się i, tak, kochamy
I zawsze po prostu mów dobranoc (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I przytulamy się, jasne, uwielbiam to
Ale potrzebuję twoich ust na moich

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh
To tylko zasada
Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh

Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la
Wszystko na moim języku, chcę tego (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la
Wszystko na moim języku, chcę tego (La-la-la-la-la-la)

Ja, czuję się jak kurwa coś
Ale moglibyśmy być ckli, pieprzyć to
Cukier, nie jestem głupkiem, głupkiem
Lubię mówić, ""A co jeśli?"" Ale jeśli
Moglibyśmy się pocałować i po prostu pokroić śmieci
Wtedy mogę być na czymś
Nie dam ci jеdnego publicznie
Daję ci setki, piеprzyć to
Coś, w co po prostu musimy się dostać
Znak pierwszy, środkowy, ostatni na zębie mądrości
Czarnuchy żałują, że cipka jest budką do pocałunku
Spróbuj śniadania, lunchu, ginu i soku
I ta kolacja też jak deser
A kiedy my Francuzi, odśwież, daj mi dwa
Kiedy przygryzę tę wargę, przyjdź po mnie też
Chce szminkę, błyszczyk do ust, malinkę też, huh

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh
To tylko zasada
Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh

Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la
Wszystko na moim języku, chcę tego (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la
Wszystko na moim języku, chcę tego

Powiedz, daj mi złotówkę, potrzebuję tych gushy rzeczy
Przesuń granicę, nie, nie jesteś wystarczająco dobry
Wszystkie twoje czarnuchy mówią, że przegrałeś beze mnie
Wszystkie moje suki czują się, jakbym unikł hrabstwa
Pieprzyć się z tobą czuć się jak więzienie, czarnuchu (Czuj się jak więzienie)
Nie mogę nawet wydychać, czarnuchu (Wydech)
Cipka jak święty Graal, wiesz o tym (Święty Graal)
Sprawisz, że będę potrzebował kaucji, wiesz o tym
Przyłapany na zanurzaniu się z twoim przyjacielem
Nie jesteś nawet w połowie, człowieku, kłamiesz na swoim ****, wiesz o tym
Kupiłem mi torbę pełną cegły, wiesz o tym
Kontroluj, nie zwalniaj tempa, jeśli odrzucę
Cały ten tyłek naprawdę (Cały ten tyłek)
Dramat sprawia, że czujesz (Sprawić, że czujesz)
Fantazja i bicz to wszystko, co mogę ci dać

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them

Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?

CashMoneyAP
Öldür onları, al onları, al onları, oh
Onları almaya çalışıyorum
Oh, oh al onları
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ne istiyorsun ? Dediğimi tekrarlamayacağım
Gece gelen bir hırsızım (Gece olunca hırsızım)

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Sana bebeğim dersem, sadece bir günlüğüne öylesindir
Veya sadece bir geceliğine, sen benim karım olamazsın
Bütün gece sevişmek için bir katil arıyor
Ben ise bir fahişe, tüm gece sakso çeksin bana
Saatim AP, büyük parçacıklı, ekibimle birlikte mahallemdeyim
5.000 harcadım akşam yemeğine, bir 300 de sen ateşle torbacıya

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Zenginim ama sürüyorum, alışmakta sıkıntı çekiyorum, Öfkelenip daha fazlasını kazanmak üzereyim
Böylesini görmemiştim, tonla para üstümde, Yüz binlerim çantamda bu çok tatlı bir iş
Baby OG, koşuşturuyordum bu sokaklarda, Lashawn'dan öğrendim piyasayı, ben annemin oğluyum
Gençken dinim hakkında bir şeyler öğrendim, İşlerin yürümediğini biliyordum ve kaptım elime silahı
Sırf Dior alabilmek için Paris'e gittim
Hatun ilgi için yalvarıyor, siklemiyorum onu
Huzur içinde yat Pop, keşke bizi görebilseydin
Ben ve CashMoney ne zaman gitsem buluşuyoruz
Caddelerde adamlarım gezer, beni yenemezsin
Ben olmaya çalışan bir endüstri var
Ray Charles'a gidiyorum, beni göremiyorlar
RiRi ile Rolls-Royce'dayım

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Geceleri bir hırsız gibi
Uğradım ve ona bu gecelik için D verdim
Arabanın içinde sevişmeye çalışıyor, bu kadar yeter
Koltuklarımın üstünde yapamayız çünkü beyaz renkteler (Bunlar benim koltuklarım orospu çocuğu koltuklarıma bak)
''Thriller'' klibinde gibi yaşıyorum hayatı sadece gece vakti dışarı çıkıyorum
Hatun likör kullanmıyor, içkili olmayı sevmiyor
Hatun Hennesy içmiyor, sadece beyaz şarap
Patlattım Pinot Grigio marka şarabı
Porsche ile yanaşıyorum, yanımda fena bir kaltak
Porshce'u park edip Lambo'ya atlıyorum
İniyorum, Major Payne, kamuflaj giyiniyorum
Sevimli hatunu sevişmeye zorladım, sevgilisini bıraktı
Ateş etmeyi ve seni sevindirmeyi severim, ben Ramboyum
Cuban Chain elmaslarla dolu, boynumu boğuyor adeta
Huzur içinde yat Pop, ölümün yaktırdı bana bir cigara

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi",

Es ist schön, es ist bittersüß
Du bist wie ein kaputtes Zuhause für mich
Ich nehme ein Zug von Erinnerungen
Und schlafe ein wie eine leere Straße
Ich fülle meine Tage damit, wie du gehst
Und fülle meine Nächte mit zerbrochenen Träumen
Ich erfinde Lügen in meinem Kopf
Wie die, dass du eines Tages zu mir zurückkеhrst

Jetzt halte ich mich nicht fest, haltе nicht fest
Ich bin einfach nur depressiv, da du weg bist
Halte nicht fest, halte nicht fest

Schöne Fehler, ich mache sie in meinem Kopf
Sie ist nackt in meinem Bett
Und jetzt liegen wir wach, machen schöne Fehler
Ich würde sie nicht zurücknehmen
Ich bin verliebt in die Vergangenheit
Und jetzt liegen wir wach, machen schöne Fehler

Nah-nah-nah, in meinem Kopf
Nah-nah-nah, in meinem Bett
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Machen schöne Fehler

Es ist erbärmlich, ich kann nicht glauben
Wie jeder Tag für mich schlimmer wird
Ich nehme eine Auszeit, ich habe dich ausgegrenzt
Um zu verhindern, dass ich nachgiebig wirke
Ich fülle meine Tage damit, wie du warst
Und wache trotzdem noch mit zerbrochenen Träumen auf
Ich ziehe diese Linien in meinem Kopf
Fühlt sich an, als seinen sie meine Realität

Jetzt halte ich mich nicht fest, halte nicht fest
Ich bin einfach nur depressiv, da du weg bist
Halte nicht fest, halte nicht fest

Schöne Fehler, ich mache sie in meinem Kopf
Sie ist nackt in meinem Bett
Und jetzt liegen wir wach, machen schöne Fehler
Ich würde sie nicht zurücknehmen
Ich bin verliebt in die Vergangenheit
Und jetzt liegen wir wach, machen schöne Fehler

Du hast mir Unrecht getan, denn ich habe dich gelassen
Normalerweise bevorzuge ich meine Situation vorteilhaft
Mache etwas anders, lässt mich dumm aussehen (Verdammt)
Der einzige Weg, bei dem ich zu dir zurückkehre ist der, wenn du davon träumst, luzid (Hmm)
Beweise es, falls du ein Versprechen getan hast, dann halte es (Halte es)
Wieso willst du liegen und dann böse werden? Das kaufe ich nicht ab (Junge, tschüss)
Aber wirklich, mir ging es gut ohne dich
Schaue gut aus, nippe am Wein, tanze auf Club-Couches (Ah)
Schatz, wieso willst du mich verlieren, als würdest du mich nicht brauchen= (Als würdest du mich nicht brauchen)
Ich blockiere dich nicht und di willst mich immer noch erreichen (Mich immer noch erreichen)
Wie du herausfindest, wie du mich per TV anrufen kannst? (Hä?)
Dir gehen die Chancen aus und diesmal meine ich es ernst (Ah)

Ja, ich wette, du vermisst meine Liebe, alles in deinem Bett (Bett)
Jetzt stresst du dich selbst, ziehst an deinen Haaren (Haaren)
Riechst an deinen Kissen und wünschst ich sei da (Ich sei da)
Rutschst an der Duschwand herab, siehst traurig aus (Traurig)
Ich weiß, dass es schwer ist loszulassen, ich bin die Beste (Ich bin die Beste)
Die Beste, die du je hattest und die Beste, die du kriegen wirst (Kriegen wirst)
Und wenn wir uns trennen will ich keine Freunde sein (Freunde sein)

Ich höre viel über Sünder

Denn die Weise, auf die sich der Himmel öffnet, wenn wir uns berühren

Und nein, ich kann nicht ertragen, dass es falsch ist

Aber die Art, wie wir in der Nacht lieben, gab mir Leben

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh, baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinkin' 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope he shows up in a 2 AM pic from a friend
Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then he calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope he comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope he spends his last dime to put a rock on your hand
I hope he's wilder than your wildest dreams
He's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me

I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free

Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back

Woah, woah
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby

Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad

Юный ниггер всегда в движении, он будет уверен, что тачка доехала—
Сделал мельницу на 360, когда покидал сцену
Вот такое нам нужно, её лучшая работа отпечаталась на её коленках
Слишком секси для этого кэша
Слишком секси для этого сиропа
Слишком секси для этих таблеток, я слишком секси для этого
Я рубаю зелень везде, где бываю, а сучки занимаются со мной сексом
Бабки, тачки и все эти ювелирки делают сучку секси
Я рубаю зелень везде, где бываю, а сучки занимаются со мной сексом

Йеа, воу, воу, воу
Я слишком секси для этого сиропа
Слишком секси для твоей девчонки
Слишком секси для этого мира
Слишком секси для этих брюликов
Слишком секси для того парниши, йеа, йеа
Я слишком секси для этой цепи
Слишком секси для твоей банды
Слишком секси для такой славы, йеа, йеа
Я слишком секси для района
Слишком секси для той лжи
Слишком секси для того парниши, йеа, йеа

Слишком секси для бабосиков (Ах), денюшек (Оу)
Шея в багетти (Ху)
Красные брюлики, спагетти (Оу)
Эти бумажки, я их разрываю (Йеа)
Надул вас, даже не вспотел
Видел тебя (Сука), молящуюся (Шлюха)
Чёрт побери, какой же ты жалок (Ха)
Я не закончил тратиться (Йеа)
Никакой экономии, я только трачу (Трачу)
Сумки с баблом вносят сюда и обратно (Дайте мне их)
Мои люди никогда не украдут их (О Боже)
Сотня сумок для неё (Сотня сумок)
Заставляю этих молодых шалав желать богатства (Ву)
Зелёные аллигаторы, выглядят, как предатели
Джорджо, я потратил двадцать шесть тыщ (Армани)
Я слишком секси (Йеа)
Моя шея (Йеа), вся в багетти
Приставай ко мне (Воу), ласкай меня (Воу)
Я тебе позволю сделать это (Ах), сделаем это сегодня (Ски)
Я распинаю это дерьма (Воу, воу), может понадобиться протез (Йеа)
Молюсь вертушке под моей подушкой, зубная фея (Ву)",

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo' edge out

I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby

Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world

I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened

Well, the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark

But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over


It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home

You know that my train could take you home

A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?

Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, ""I’m the one,"" they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, now they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathin'

I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

Herkes adımı biliyor
Ama bununla ilgili bir şeyler hala tuhaf hissettiyor
Aynaya bakmak gibi
Kendini sabitlemeye ve başka birini görmeye çalışıyorsun
Ve şimdi her şey aynı değil
Tüm hayatlarımız değişmiş gibi hissettiriyor
Belki büyüdüğümde, hepsi diner
Ama şimdi bu beni öldürüyor

Ya arayacak kimse dışında her şeye sahip olsaydın?
Belki o zaman beni anlardın
Çünkü her şeye sahiptim
Ama kimse dinlemiyordu
Ve bu kahrolası bir yalnızlık

Çok yalnızım
Yalnız

Herkes geçmişimi biliyor
Evim her zaman camdan yapılmış gibiydi
Erken yaşta para ve şöhret için
Ödediğim bedel belki de budur
Ve herkes beni hastayken gördü
Ve kimsenin umurunda değilmiş gibi hissettim
Aptal bir çocuk olarak yaptıklarımı eleştirdiler

I walked away, you won me then

Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me

Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?

Just can't make it all alone

'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me

Wouldn't have to fake a smile

I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in

You wouldn't be all

Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to

It wouldn't be so hard to see you
Know how much I need you
Wouldn't hate that I still feel like I do

Tengo que alimentar las calles, mi pistola va a sangrar las calles
Pasamontañas en mi cara, a veces tienes que hacer trampa
Para mantenerse a la vanguardia en esta perra (pandilla), bebí jarabe como si fuera licor
La vida en la calle te hará alcanzar a Dios más rápido (sí, pandilla)
Pegatina, AK-40 para tu hígado
Deja que el helicóptero te golpee como un Blood o un Cripper (pandilla)
Aleta, tanto pan, soy gimnasta
Hice tanto dinero con tontos, con tontos (sí, pandilla)

Soy el señor cazador de cuerpos, ladrón de almas de Slaughter Gang
No es un F-150 normal, este es un maldito Raptor
Sin gorra, negro callejero, no rapero
El Chopper lo golpeó y se convirtió en un badajo de botín
Smith & Wesson, soy representante del 4L Gang
Hemos bautizado más negros que el maldito reverendo (sí)
Kappa Alpha, yo y mi pandilla, hacemos todos los pasos
¿A quién estás revisando? Este FN dispara de este a oeste (pandilla)

Sí
Oí a papi afuera
Y tiene la doble R caída afuera
Verifiqué el clima y se está poniendo muy feliz afuera
Voy a dejar esta mierda y hacer que estos coños caigan como unos malditos—
Tipo de negro que no puede mirarme a los ojos
Desprecio
Cuando te vea, será mejor que dejes ese maldito orgullo a un lado
Muchas veces, muchas veces, sobreviví
La pelea está viva, alerta de spoiler, este negro muere

Mantén blickies, y sabes que la hierba es pegajosa
Me pica el dedo, a la pistola le gusta dejar chupones
Tus tiradores dudan, un punk callejero nunca podría disuadirme
Salgo directamente del 6, y no perdonamos mariquitas

Follo con ella y follo con ella y ella
La golpeé, err, y le digo que haga el error, seguro
Maldición vudú, lo atrapó mientras volaba a los turcos
Sé que los perros tuvieron que golpearlos donde sabíamos que duele

Mierda de pandillas, eso es todo en lo que estoy (sí)
Mierda de pandillas, eso es todo en lo que estoy

Déjalo explotar, explotar, déjalo explotar, explotar
Hasta que su cerebro cuelgue y su mamá cante
Y el pastor cantó y las balas cantaron
Y los helicópteros cantaron y el coro cantó

Estoy en todo
Jacob me cobró cuatrocientos cincuenta por una cadena de tenis
US Open, lo teníamos con nosotros en el juego de tenis
Dile al entrenador que no me saque, me gusta terminar los partidos
Y mi pluma loca, y mis hombres locos
Ahora somos como ochenta, eso es lo que da miedo
Mierda que están haciendo en ese otro lado vergonzoso
Nosotros en París con él, cien quilates con él
Toda esta mierda es para mi hijo, porque la está heredando

This life had left me so scarred, I'm knowing that's true
Remember times got so hard, I got it tattoed (So hard)
I ain't did no shows but made some bread (Yeah)
I gotta keep the family fed (Yeah, yeah)
Look, just talked to pops about the feds
I ain't gon' lie, he had me scarеd, uh
I feel 'em coming, nigga (Yeah)
I'll keep on running, nigga (Yeah)
If wе go down bad, keep it a hundred, nigga
My girl all in my ear screaming, ""Spend some time""
I promise I'll be here when I can get some time
Right now, I got to get what's mine (For sure)
I'll be thuggin' 'til the end of time
And fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name
Make sure you write the truest in the motherfucking game

On my tombstone when they bury me
By the river, they will carry me
Finally, I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally
I'll get to fly away, somewhere, someday
Fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name (Yeah)
Make sure you write the truest in the game
On my tombstone when they bury me (Yeah)
By the river, they will carry me (Yeah)
Finally, I'll be resting in peace (Oh yeah)
Finally, finally, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(You know what I’m saying, I don’t really know what I’m saying, I don’t know what’s after this shit)
Finally, finally (Everybody think they know but fuck it, I sleep on the floor)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (This shit comes with a lot, it’s a lot of pressure, I’m a young nigga though)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
On my tombstone when they bury me (Believe that man, I’m a hustler)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, on my tombstone when they bury me, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, finally I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally, on my tombstone when they bury me
By the river, they will carry me, I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally, yeah","rap, trap, Hip-Hop, hip hop, Trap Soul"

Firewood crackle in the fall air
""Red Dirt"" playing on a radio
Big Dipper hanging high up there
Breathe in the Backwoods and let it go

I ain't ever been the church goin' type
Can't quote much past 3:16
Even though it's a Friday night
Church found me

Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen

Tell em' boys
Yeah, baby

Gotta thank him for a little piece of dirt
Little peace of mind from a cold one
Got a country angel I don't deserve
The kind that you never let go of

I don't know what Heaven looks like
No, I don't think anybody does
If it's like down here up there tonight
And there's folks like us

Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (Talkin' God, amen)
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends (With some downhome friends)
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen (Talkin' God, amen)
(Talkin' God, amen)

I don't know what Heaven looks like
And who the hell does?
If it's like down here up there tonight
There's folks like us

Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (Talkin' God, amen)
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends (With some downhome friends)
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense (Man, it all makes sense)
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen (Talkin' God, amen)

(Sittin' here, drinkin' beer) Talkin' God, amen
(Talkin' God, amen) We're sittin' here, drinkin' beer
Talkin' God, amen",

One, two
One, two, three, four
Dice, Ra-Rauw

El viento soba tu cabello
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Me matan esos ojos bellos
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Me gusta tu olor, de tu piel el color
Y cómo me haces sentir
Me gusta tu boquita, ese labial rosita
Y cómo me besas a mí (Yeh)

Contigo quiero despertar
Hacerlo después de fumar (Ey)
Ya no tengo na' que buscar
Algo fuera de aquí
Tú combinas con el mar
Ese bikini se ve fenomenal
No hay gravedad que me pueda elevar
Me pones mal a mí (¡Yah!)

Aceleras to’ mis latidos
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
De toa' tus parte’, ¿cuál decido?
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti

Quinta Avenida, no va pa'l mall
Ella sabe que le llego a solo un call
En la Raptor me gusta ponerla en four
El jogger large, la camisa small
Como la dieta keto
Por ti, me controlo y me quedo quieto
Aunque quiero comerte to' eso completo
De ese culo me volví un teco, eh
Mi-Mi-Micro dosi', rola, oxi
Besando eso' labio’ glossy
Ya yo le di en to’a la' posi
Champú de coco, Chanel su wallet
Me vuelve loco desde el casco hasta lo’ pedale'

Contigo quiero despertar (Oh-oh)
Hacerlo después de fumar
Ya no tengo na' que buscar
Algo fuera de aquí
Tú combinas con el mar (Eh)
Ese bikini se ve fenomenal (Eh-eh)
No hay gravedad que me pueda elevar
Me pones mal a mí (¡Yah!)

Aceleras to' mis latidos
Y e’ que me gusta todo de ti
De toa' tus parte', ¿cuál decido?
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti

Ah, ah-ah (Todo de ti), ah-ah (Todo de ti), ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
Ah, ah-ah (Todo de ti), ah-ah (Todo de ti), ah-ah
Y e' que me gusta todo de ti
