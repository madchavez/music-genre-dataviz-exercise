For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself","pop, black metal, rnb, justin bieber, Hip-Hop"

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)

Senin tarzını seviyorum bebek

Eller belde
Öne ve arkaya
Biliyorsun rol yapmıyorum
Sokaklar güvenli değil
Fakat asla kaçmadım
Uzakta olsam bile
Hayır, hayır, kentin dışında asla yeteri kadar sevgi yok
Tek parça dönmek için dua ediyorum
Dua ediyorum, dua ediyorum

Bu yüzden bir dansa ihtiyacım var
Elimde bir Hennessy var
Gitmeden önce bir kez daha
Yüksek güçler beni tutuyor
Bir dansa ihtiyacım var
Elimde bir Hennessy var
Gitmeden önce bir kez daha
Yüksek güçler beni tutuyor

Senin tarzını seviyorum bebek

Güç ve idare
Arkadaşlarım için bütün dilediğim bu
Benim mahallemden kimse bunu yapamaz
Sessizliği parçalamalıydım
Biliyorsun yanımda kalmalısın
Yazıyı görür görmez bana yanıt ver
Zamanı kavga ederek harcamak istemiyorum
Hiç zamanımız yok

Bu yüzden bir dansa ihtiyacım var
Elimde bir Hennessy var
Gitmeden önce bir kez daha
Yüksek güçler beni tutuyor
Bir dansa ihtiyacım var
Elimde bir Hennessy var
Gitmeden önce bir kez daha
Yüksek güçler beni tutuyor

Güzel bir kız var ve o, beni uzun zamandır seviyor
Dans et, dans et, uzun zamandır
Oh evet, uzun zamandır
Geri geri git, geri geri git, geri geri git ve dans et
Geri geri git, geri geri git, geri geri git ve dans et bebeğim
Geri geri git, geri geri git, geri geri git ve dans et
Oh evet, uzun zamandır
Geri geri git, geri geri git, geri geri git ve dans et bebeğim

Söyle bana
Bilmeliyim, nereye gitmek istiyorsun?
Çünkü eğer istiyorsan, yavaşlayabilirim
Sana kontrolünü kaybettiriyor

Nereye, nereye, nereye
Nereye, nereye, nereye, nereye (Oh evet, uzun zamandır)
Nereye, nereye, nereye (Geri geri git, geri geri git ve dans et bebeğim)
Nereye, nereye, nereye, nereye
Çünkü eğer istiyorsan (Geri geri git, geri geri git ve)

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away

I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

Nostalgia from ages 7, 11, and 20 are explored before the band goes on to wonder about their life in the… Read More 
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writin' 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty

Realize how much I need you

I hate you, I love you

Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit

I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent

Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'

And I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here

And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to

And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here","pop, soul, rnb, Canadian, female vocalists"

Te vi mientras te ibas pero parezco no ser capaz de dejarte ir
Porque en algún momento fuiste mi todo
Esta claro que tiempo no ha cambiado nada
Esta enterrado en mi interior pero siento que hay algo que debes saber

Ona verdiğim bir nokta iki milyon dolar sadece canını yakmak içindi, ah
Tüm sahip olduğum Lamborghini'ler sadece seni kızdırmak için, ah
Bu arabaların hiçbiri kiralık değil, ah
Senin yıllık kazancını bir haftada kazanırım, ah
Birinci sürtüğüm senin liginde değil, ah
İkinci sürtüğüm de senin liginde değil, ah

Ev çok boş, ortaya bir şey lazım
Bu yüzden abanoz ağacından kesilmiş, yirmi bin dolarlık bir masa koydum

Sonra burnu ile temizliyor, adamım, bebeğimi seviyorum
Hep paran hakkında konuşuyorsun, işitme cihazına ihtiyacın var
Benim hakkımda konuşuyorsun, üzerimde gölge göremiyorum
Tarzımı değiştirip, her şekile girerim
İçkimi yenileyip, her acıyı dindiririm

Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um
Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um

Her gün zencinin teki beni sınamaya çalışıyor, ah
Her gün zencinin teki sonumu getirmeye çalışıyor, ah
Roadster SV arabamın içindeyim kenara çekmişim, ah
Ceplerim aşırı dolu ağırlaşıyor, ah
Kralın peşinden geliyorsun, bu senin için çok uzun bir mesafe, ah
Ben hayata sonbaharda gelirim, ah

Yeah, I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last two-hundred twenty-three thousand hours
And it's 'cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat-flat
And your ass on ""What's that?""
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl, not right now
I would never go and chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her— man

I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—

Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah, I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood, I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet?

I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough, we reached Neverland
Peacefully, my feet hit the sand

And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland

I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase

To supply all of my heart's demands (Hey)
Suit and tie, 'cause undercover (Hey)

Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle

Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek

No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable

Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?

Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it

Visit grandpa every chance that you can

Always stay humble and kind

It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
Uh

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way)
From where we began (You know where we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (Let me tell you)
When I see you again

Oh, oh
Ooh (Yeah)
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day
Without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way
From where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Oh (Uh), oh (Yeah-yeah; yeah)
Ooh (Yo, yo, uh)
When I see you again (See you again, yeah, yeah)
Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah, yeah; oh-oh)
Ooh (Uh-huh, yup)
When I see you again",rap

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

And if you like cameras flashin' every time we go out
Oh, yeah
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Then baby, I'm perfect
And baby, we're perfect

If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now","pop, british, boyband, one direction, X factor"
