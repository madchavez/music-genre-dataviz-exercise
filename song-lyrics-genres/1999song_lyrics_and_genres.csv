I'll be your shoulder when you cry

All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely

She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

You'll never shine if you don't glow

You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standin' all around
Something warm rollin' through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me, darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her, our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
Well, now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life, that night

Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Never seen a sun shine like this
Never seen the moon glow like this
Never seen the waterfalls like this
Never seen the lights off like this
Never dug anyone like this
Never had tasty lips to kiss
Never had someone to miss
Never wrote a song quite like this

Fortunate to have you girl

Just as sure as the sky is blue
I bless the day that I found you

Never had room service all night
Never took a trip first class flight
Never had a love affair so tight
I've never felt a feeling so right
Never seen a winter so white
Never had words to recite
Never had a flame to ignite
And I never sang a song with all my might

Fortunate to have you girl

Just as sure as the sky is blue
I bless the day that I found you

I'm callin out to your body

He like to hang out late, he like to get shit-faced and keep pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught up in the midst of all of this pain
You know it crumbles that way, at least that's what they say when they play the game

Yeah

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night

Oh-oh, you think you're something special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you've got a car

So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much (That don't impress me)
Oh, oh no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night

Behind my back, all that riffin ya did

Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that
He got mad weapons too? Ain't tryna hear that

When y'all clowns gon' see that it can't be done
Understand me, son, I'm the slickest they is

Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all

Boy, if I do
The things you want me to (Uh-huh)
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Uh-huh)
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me

You'd go and break my heart

It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things that you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love to you
But I cannot resist at all

Boy, if I do (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah-yes)
The things you wanna do
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Love me, oh)
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

You'd go and break my heart (Alright, yo)

She wanna shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi (Uh-huh), rub up in the movies (Uh-huh)
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her mom's
She calls me ""heartbreaker""
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down ""I hate ya""
But she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all

(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me (Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start, (Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (Ah)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (Ooh)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start (I should have known)
You'd go and break my heart (That you would go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (Break it down)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

And nothing's changed

Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I'm filled with all the joy I could find

Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands

We both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong
And, baby, it's killing me, it's killing you
Both of us trying to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusts me fast asleep

I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that

It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye, and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (Oh, ho)
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you

I know that we'll meet again
Fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life

Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember
When we met that summer?

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie & Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

Hip hop, marmalade, spick-and-span
Met you one summer and it all began
You're the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird, Jersey 33
When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willie Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer, then went back home
Macaulay Culkin wasn't home alone
Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton

When I met you, I said my name is Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits

But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

Cherry Pez, Cold Crush, Rockstuds, Boogie
Used to hate school, so I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the B-boy style
Known to act wild and make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Reminds me of you 'cause you rock my world
You come from Georgia, where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade and speak real slow
You love hip hop and rock and roll
Dad took off when you were four years old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I feel much better, baby, when you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke

When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch

Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

In the summertime, girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey, like I stole your bike

Boogaloo Shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back there oh so quick
Let you off the hook, like my man Mr. Limpet
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it
I like The Color Purple, macaroni and cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
Call you up, but what's the use?
I like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose
Came in the door, I said it before
I think I'm over you, but I'm really not sure

When I met you, I said my name was Rich

You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again

Well, it's nothin', it's so normal

Well, I was thinkin' if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

Knows everyone here is thinkin' 'bout somebody else

Well, this ain't no good, in fact, it's phony as hell
Yeah, but things worked out just like you wanted to
If you see me out, you don't know me
Try to turn your head, try and give me some room
I'll figure out just what I'm gonna do

'Cause everyone here
Hates everyone here for doin' just like they do
And it's best if we all keep this quiet instead

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin' the heat, uh
Ha-ha, can y'all feel that?
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh

Here I am, in the place where I come let go
In Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work, all play, okay?
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me and Charlie at the bar, runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like, ""Hi, Will!""
Can y'all feel me? All ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out, ""Will, we loved your last hit!""
So I'm thinkin' I'ma scoop me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees in the Caribbean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay, papi!""
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound, anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
And if you ask how I know, I got's to plead the fifth

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimme your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jet skis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, everybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise, in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home (Miami)

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn

If I could tell the world just one thing it would be
That we're all okay
And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful and useless in times like these
I won't be made useless
I won't be idle with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken
Poverty stole your golden shoes
It didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But I knew it wasn't ever after
We'll fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken

In the end, only kindness matters
In the end, only kindness matters

I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray

My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken
My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own and
I am never broken

You!

I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change in my life
Starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would

(And baby it's you)
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name and smile
(Baby, you)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night
(Baby, you)
Every morning you rise
And open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours
From this day forth

Next year lets call this day our anniversary
The day I put
My heart in your hand
And said that it was yours to keep
From this moment on say that you'll always be mine
'Cuz, girl, when I'm alone with you
There's only one thing that's on my mind

(And baby it's you)
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name and smile
(Baby, you)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night

Those were the words I said to you

Then you told me that you loved me
More than anything in your life
So I asked you would you do me
The honor of being my wife

Yes I will
I will be your man
Your protector, your best friend
Till my humble life is ended
And time begins again, couldn't we be...

Couldn't we be happily ever after?
We could be strong together for so long
My love is oh so strong
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
Couldn't we be?
Leaving you never till forever's gone

When I was away, mmm, mmm
Some friends became just faces
Some people grew apart
But you stayed right in my heart
And so many times
Pictured this day inside my mind
And for so many years, ooh
I knew it would be you here with me, oh

Yes I will
Take you for my wife

Indulging in my self-defeat

A comfortable three feet deep

Impaired my tribal lunar speak

I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come

It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know, if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal
Yeah

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one
Yeah, yeah

It's so incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would've made it very far
'Cause you know you've got the keys to my heart
'Cause

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the dark of night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one","soul, rnb, Brian McKnight, rhythm and blues, r&b"

I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying ""damn"" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
(Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around

'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
Running out of love
And then it's too late to talk about it

Oh yeah, oh yeah

Whoa, listen...
If you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays

When a woman's...
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
Mama taught me a long time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it
Oh no, oh no
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
Running out of love
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

 (throughout repeating chorus)
""You can cry a river
'Til an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same, no, no
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you""
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa

Right outside of Chicago

Big orange ball, sinking in the water
Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter
Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil, tanning señoritas
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels
Hands on the wheel, cruising down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going as fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight’s the night, feels like perfect timing
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm going to die if she really says yes
I want to know how forever feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

I want to know how forever feels

Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone, or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh, it feels like the first time every time
I want to spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do

You tell me you're in love with me

You betta count your money, boy

The name is Krayzie, big bad-ass Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayor's daughter
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with it, so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double-crossed by the law, so there's nobody to run to
Yeah, it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face
I'm headed for the West
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin' dark so now now I'm watchin' for them damn injuns
They like to catch us, then they rob and split
I be a rootin', tootin', shootin' damn fool, protecting my chips
All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse ""Woah, Nelly""
Who in the bushes? You betta speak out or I'ma let my shotgun song sing out
Who is this? Hope this ain't the law, jar out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun
Come on out right now, I'm gettin' angry
Took a step back 'cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot, it's just me, Thug Queen, the horse stealer
Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes?
I'm wanted in four counties
For armed robberies
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law, that's why I jumped in them bushes
Goodness, now she was hotter than the barrel of fire
But I could use her for the job, so I told her to ride come on
May I ask you what you headed to the West for?
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you down, you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you with it
We out before the sunrise
Got a stallion for ya partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine
Down for whatever, let's ride, let's ride
These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive, we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the morning for details and hookups

You betta count your money (Ghetto)
You betta count your money (Cowboy)
You betta count your money (Ghetto)
You betta count your money (Cowboy)

Rise and shine, good morning, howdy
Nine o' clock, we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now I done came a long way, I don't wanna be late
Tell him we make it to him
You know where we at (Move out!)

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up
You betta count your money (Ghetto)
You betta count your money (Cowboy)

I'm peepin' Krazyie's warning poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble 'round here pretty soon
Glance across the room, I see this youngster gettin' ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So I approach him and I pause
""Look, man, I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws
Come messing up this master plan?""
Since he already rowdy, I just asked the man, hey
""You want some work? Well, partna, put in ya bid
Now, by the way, what's your name? They call me Layzie the Kid""
""The names Powder P, can I get a 12-gauge?
Outlaw everyday on the front page
Mr Kid, if you give me the low down
Me and Blackjack, we ready for the showdown
With two double barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm perdy clever""
So saddle up jump on the bandwagon
Because its all goin' down
I heard a guy run in the bar screaming Krayzie's in town
Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside and don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses
Stepped inside the bar, Layzie Kid, you son of a gun!
Hey, man, I'm glad you made it safely
Now let's go have some fun
And this my partner powder he's a young gun
Howdy
Mighty glad to meet ya, son
Oh yeah, you know, I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen, the horse peddler
Straggler, just met her
Howdy partner
Already got the horses saddled up
I hope you good at robbing banks
Like you rustle that cattle
Now y'all
It's gon' be gettin' dark real soon
I think you right
I say we move, come on, let's move out!

From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not

Then I put it down type Braille

Don’t you ever wish
You were someone else?
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don’t you ever say
You don’t like the way you are?
When you learn to love yourself
You’re better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
‘Cause there’s nothing ‘bout you I would change

I think that you could be whatever you wanted to be
If you could realize all the dreams you have inside
Don’t be afraid if you got something to say
Just open up your heart and let it show you the way

Don’t you ever wish
You were someone else?
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don’t you ever say
You don’t like the way you are?
When you learn to love yourself
You’re better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
‘Cause there’s nothing ‘bout you I would change

Believe in yourself
Reach down inside
The love you find will set you free
Believe in yourself
You will come alive
Have faith in what you do
You’ll make it through, whoa, oh
Hey

Don’t you ever wish
You were someone else?
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don’t you ever say
You don’t like the way you are?
When you learn to love yourself
You’re better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
‘Cause there’s nothing ‘bout you I would change

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now
And all I could taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am


And you can't fight the tears that ain't comin'
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

The song was featured in the pilot and series finale of the TV show Malcolm in the Middle.(It goes a little something like, like, like this)

In my shoes my toes are busted
My kitchen says my bread is molded
I got a good job at the dollar store
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
With a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker
I ain't got much else to lose
I'm faded, flat busted
Been jaded, I've been dusted
I know that I've seen better days
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out

Now, my cup's filled up with five-buck wine
I find myself here all the time
Another rip in the glass, another chip in my tooth
Rained on, I've been stained on
Found another goat I try to put the blame on
And now I'm stepping on all the cracks, so I guess there ain't no use

Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out

Like my Gucci bag?
That's beautiful, beautiful
Check it, check it out

I'm bent like glass, second hand like glory
Missed the bus, but I'm in no hurry
Molasses fast, no business born
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out

I know that I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)
I've been the star of so many plays
(And the bottom drops out)
I walked on the edge without a hold whole way
(And the bottom drops out)
Cause I know, I know that I've seen better, better days

I never saw the end in sight
Fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright
But I was running out of time
'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read them every day
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know

So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure


You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words long after we're gone

Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go

Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
Oh (Mmm, yeah)

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles

And it's easy to give in to your fears, oh (Oh)
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still, resilient voice
Says help is very near, oh

There can be miracles (Miracles)

Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe
Somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)

Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words how I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

I never thought that love could feel like this
Then you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be, that right here with me
There's an angel, it's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(A little more time) I'm sure we do
(Yes he did, baby)

In all of creation, all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world

And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child
It's deep inside, and leaves me purified

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(On you, yes he did, baby) Yes he did

I never thought that love could feel like this
Then you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be, that right here with me
