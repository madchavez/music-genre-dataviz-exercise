I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Now)

Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold-ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie-brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Men's)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dope
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand? Man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't
Goodwill
Poppin' tags, yeah

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I'm in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on)

Mack'in dönüşü
Yakala onları, bu ne? Ne yapıyor? Bu ne? Ne değil?
Yataktan kalkmanın daha iyi bir yöntemini arıyorum
İnternete girip
Kim bana yazmış bakmak yerine, kalk
İkinci el dükkanı, götü kalkık pezevenk yürüyüşü
Biraz alçakgönüllü, biraz temkinli
Rocky ve Cosby arasında bir yerde
Kazak oyunu, yok, yok, kopyalayamazsınız, evet
Bad, ay yürüyüşü, işte bu bizim partimiz
Ekibim Broadway'de bulundu, ve kendi yöntemimizle yaptık
Yetişkin müizği, kaydettiğim her şeye
Derimi döküyorum ve kemiklerimi koyuyorum ve hala ayaktayım
Bırak sahne ışığı yansın ve aşağı aydınlatsın
Takım giyişimde Bob Barker ve tarzımda Plinko var
Para, işime odaklı kalıyorum ve vuranlar için etrafta takılıyorum
Ama meşaleyi aktarıp kasabam için yakıyorum

Evet, çok minnettarım
Dişime altın kaplatmak isteyerek büyüdüm
Ama seni Wu-Tang yetiştirirse böyle olursun
Beni durduramazsınız
Kalp atışımda 808 varmış gibi harika bir iş çıkarıyorum
Ve ritmi Shark Week'de büyük beyaz köpekbalığına
Biraz hız vermişsin gibi yiyorum, saf
Patlama zamanı, kaçtım
Çift el, elveda, görmem gereken bir dünya var
Ve sevgilim, Roma'yı görmek istiyor
Sezar seni bir inançlı yapacak
Yok, asla bir taht için yapmadım

Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and

Parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours

But she's dancin' with another man

Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways

Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I got my windows down and the radio up (Yeah)
Get your radio up, what up, Nelly? (Alright)
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord,"" she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said (I said)

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit (Hey), would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

Yeah, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck"" (I said)

Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise (Hey)

My windows down, my seats back, my music up, and we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard, and it's just the way I like
Hey, country girl, this country boy like e'rything about ya
Don't change a thing, no way, you stay the same and I got ya
I likes all that, all that, head to toe, you all that
Tell ole boy he call back, send her a text, say, ""Fall back,"" 'cause
I can see you got a thing for the fast life (For the fast life)
So, come on, shawty, let me show you what the fast like (Uh-huh)

High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again

'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity

Walk on through a red parade
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground
And makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you

'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, ""Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
'Cause we—

38,39,"""Love Me""",Lil Wayne featuring Drake and Future,"2 ContributorsRap Critic Reviews: “Love Me” by Lil Wayne feat. Drake and Future LyricsHi, I’m the Rap Critic. Well… Lil Wayne has a new single, and it’s called “Love Me”. Well, with a title like that, I don’t know what to expect. However, after “How to Love” turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life, maybe a song titled “Love Me” would be a more personal number. Contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships. And yeah, it could just be another crappy bragging song, but I like to be optimistic when I go into a review. So... what? That’s not the full title of the song? What’s the full title of the song?
Drake: Bitches love me
Man, I feel stupid. Well, let’s get this over with
Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
-stupid, unnecessary audio watermark for the producer-
*sneers*
I don’t know what I was doing-
Wait. What was that thing she’s wearing? Is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle? A mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much? Wow, we’ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory, haven’t we? I mean… you know what, I haven’t even started talking about the lyrics yet. I’m just gonna let this one go
Okay, so this song, which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit, is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex. And…maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff! Like, you know, headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now. Or swing sets. Yeah…
Future: Imma ball ‘til the day I fall
One more thing before we continue. When did this Future character here, a guy who barely passes as a rapper, let alone a singer, become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy? I mean, according to what I’m seeing on the lyric sheet, he has no verse! So without his own full verse, the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook. And I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but…
(shows a cover of the single for “Loveeee Song” by Future and Rihanna as that song plays)
Future isn’t exactly a powerhouse vocalist. I mean, could Lil Wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks? Aren’t you still friends with T-Pain? At least that guy has some personality, this guy is… huh. Funny that a guy named Future is relying on a vocal effect that’s near extinction. I mean, when even T-Pain says...
T-Pain: Auto tune is on its way out!

Back in 2008, I think it’s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously. But back to the song
Drake: Long as my bitches love, my bitches love
Wait, now Drake is on the chorus? Is this the Drake and Future collaboration the world was waiting for? He doesn’t have a verse either, so I can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting. But forgive me again, we need to get back to the song
Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
So the song is about how he doesn’t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him. Which is typical, but for some reason, in this song he’s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky, confident braggadocio. Actually listen to the song without the arrogant, too cool to care faces in the music video. And really listen to their voices:
Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
Is there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess? I mean, if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is, that would be perfect, but it’s not. And usually, failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that’s full of vigor and 808, but he can’t do that here, since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that’s present on nearly every friggin’ song featuring Drake, and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens, their lifeless delivery stops the song dead!
Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
Does he actually sound convinced here? Does he legitimately sound like he doesn’t care about haters? I don’t know about you guys, but to me it sounds like he’s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve. All I hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess! And we haven’t even gotten to the verses yet!
Lil Wayne: Pussy ass niggas, stop hating
So, you don’t care about haters in any way, shape or form, and only care about your women... but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters. Because you know, what better way to show that you don’t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them?
(montage of Wayne mentioning haters throughout the song)

I don’t know about you, but there’s something slightly contradictory about shouting, “HEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!”
Lil Wayne: Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man!
D-do hoes like Satan? I mean, I know hoes are known for having questionable morality, but I don’t think anyone actively likes Satan. I don’t even think Satanists likes Satan, they just do it to piss off Christians. I mean I know you’re trying to relate the Satan and fire thing, but hoes don’t like fire either!
Lil Wayne: And these hoes love me like Satan, man!
You know, believe it or not, but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that Lil Wayne is part of some demonic cult. And honestly, if you think some post-production CGI inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think Lil Wayne works for the devil... then he does work for the devil... and he’s going to kill you
Lil Wayne: Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she’s on a strict diet
You don’t know how segways work, do you? I mean, what thought process takes you from “I’m going to kill you!” to “This chick is all about my penis.” For real! The only piece of transitional material we get is the word “and”. And I don’t know about you, but linking two phrases together with the word “and” is not the same as a transitional phrase, and I like nipples
Lil Wayne: She don’t want money
She wants the time we could spend
Pfft. Yeah, okay. Lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you!
Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”

Okay… I’m, I’m trying to explain what’s wrong with these lines, and what disturbs me about them. Because it’s not just about the fact that they’re objectifying the girl in question. No, that’s to be expected with Wayne. But it’s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that. And I just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question:
Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
In what way does this NOT sound like an abusive relationship? In what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who’s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her? I mean it’s not overtly stating it, but it’s definitely implied. (sees a shot of a woman in the scolds bridle) Wow. That is not helping. But anyway, in his episode of Behind the Music, he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him, and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that. If this is true, it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself. And you know what? He’s an artist, and an artist telling you about his perspective doesn't always have to be a positive thing
But my problem lies not in his questionable morals…well actually yes it does, but it’s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular, plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls! I mean, he’s making no bones about the fact that he doesn’t respect you, so at this point, if you’re still trying to get with him, your motivations are probably no better than his, and I think you know what I mean when I talk about the motivations of these types of women. You know, those women, always wanting to spend all of your time…
Lil Wayne: She wants the time we could spend
*scoff* Heartless succubus. But hey, maybe he’s not that bad. Maybe when he’s with these women, he’s actually respectful of the... I’m sorry, are there women in cages like circus animals? So…let me get this straight. Lupe Fiasco makes a song that barely charts, talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects, and should hold themselves to a higher standard, and he’s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff. But Lil Wayne has a top 10 hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages?! With lines like...
Lil Wayne: I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
And… nobody’s making a stink about this! I’m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything, I just think it’s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on, while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay. But where was I? Oh, yes. So like I was saying, I’m sure in real life, Wayne is very respectful to women…
Lil Wayne: These hoes got pussies like craters
Damn! That…that imagery! Again, to all the women still wanting to have sex with Lil Wayne: THIS is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas! *picture of a crater* So…I think he’s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you’re all whores!
Lil Wayne: Can’t treat these hoes like ladies, man!
Hey…who do you treat like a lady? Because by acknowledging the idea of lady, you’re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status. But none of the girls you’ve ever met have achieved that status in your head. So it’s not that you’re saying that all women are whores; you’re just saying that all women you refer to are whores. Hmm... I wonder how that works for other things
""I’m not saying that all Chinese people are good at math, play piano and know Kung Fu, I’m just saying that all the Chinese people I’m ever going to refer to are good at math, play piano and know Kung-where’s everybody going?""
Lil Wayne: Pussy, money, weed, codeine
Was that a lyric, or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to?
Lil Wayne: She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed: 69, 96
Wait. What do those last numbers have to do with anything? Are you saying that you and her are 69’ing each other? Well that doesn’t work, since you only mention that she’s going down on you! And what is 96 supposed to mean?! Do you know why it’s called 69, Wayne? Because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other. So what is 96 supposed to represent? Two people…facing away from each other? What, are they lying on each other’s butts? That makes no sense!
Lil Wayne: I feel her heartbeat
It’s a little late to get romantic, don’t you think?
Lil Wayne: I chest to chest with this bitch
Yeah, I thought so
Lil Wayne: Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it’s like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
Hold on a minute, maybe the song’s trying to say something. Maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn’t actually lead to a fulfilling life. And maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet! Of course there’s no real revelation, he just continues to talk about haters and hoes
Lil Wayne: Now kiss my ass if you hatin
I’m getting ass or I’m skating
Anything that keeps you from playing the guitar. *shows a scene of Wayne playing the guitar live* Yeah, keep hitting those two notes, buddy. I’m sure the people who play the Beginner mode on Guitar Hero are impressed
Yeah, overall, this gets a 0 out of 5 from me. The melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song, which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it. And the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat! And his rhymes are terrible. There’s no wordplay here that’s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist. It crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance. And ultimately, does not make for a good listening experience
And that’s pretty much all I have to say about that. Well, I’m the Rap Critic. You don’t have to like my opinion, but I don’t have to like your song
(post-outro scene)
I don’t know about you, but there’s something slightly contradictory about saying, “HEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!” (Someone in the distance: OKAY!"") *chuckles*",

When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll

How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better
To never ask why

Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die

Funny how the heart can be deceiving

Why do we fall in love so easy?

I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no

Champagne bucket still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket
Kleenex, get a call, just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the boss staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell them Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck and Lee Prince's parents
Buy my mama chandeliers, I'm in tears, dammit
Thirty years you'd have thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanished
No cheers, I know you woulda panicked

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days, I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way

Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear

Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We're goin' all the way""

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Ayy, this could be perfect (Yeah)

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang

So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang

So crank the bass up like crazy

Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket

And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are, though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow

Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life

Well, I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fistfight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said, ""We are not, we are not shining stars""
This I know, I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

Woah, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine
After all, they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phones
Show me how no one's ever gonna stop us now


'Cause we are, we are shining stars
We are invincible, we are who we are
On our darkest day, when we're miles away
So we'll come, we will find our way home

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and

I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop

Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists

I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation (Ah)
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make (Ah)
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, well, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl, you know I love it when you

Get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on

Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Ridin' high, roll up on the down low
Feelin' lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here

And get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on

Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl

You know I love it when you get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on

Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody's been there
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing, bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go, oh, woah, mm, oh
And you let her go, oh, woah, uh, no
Well, you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my headlights, that's my truck
Come on, baby, don't you keep me waitin'
I gotta go, I've got a reservation
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms

Come on, baby, let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock, now we're knockin' on midnight
Me and you, girl, runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'til the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey, baby, all we got is all night
Come on now, we're runnin' outta moonlight

Girl, I bet you thought I lost my mind
Out of the blue pullin' into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear?
