A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""

Come and move that in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

Oh, you, you are the magnet and I'm the metal
I keep getting closer and building up the plan
Just thinking about it raises my heartbeat
Oh, yeah I, I'm already liking you more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This needs to be taken with no hurry

Slowly
I want to smell your neck slowly
Let me whisper things in your ear
So that you'll remember if you're not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with my kisses, slowly
I sign the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript
(Hop on, hop on, hop on!
Hop on, hop on!)

I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm
And you show my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
To make you scream
And you forget your last name

If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me
I know that you're thinking about it
I've been trying for a while
Baby, this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with mine makes you go bang-bang
You know that she is looking for my bang-bang
Come, taste from my mouth to see what it tastes like
I want to, I want to, I want to see how much love you can take in
I am not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
Let's start slow, then wild

Step by step, smooth and gentle
We're sticking together, little by little
When you kiss me with such skill
I see that you're malice with tenderness
Step by step, smooth and gentle
We start sticking, little by little
And such beauty is a puzzle
But to solve it here I have the piece
Listen!

Slowly
I want to smell your neck slowly
Let me whisper things in your ear
So that you remember if you're not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with my kisses, slowly
I sign the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript
(Hop on, hop on, hop on!
Hop on, hop on!)

I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm
And you show my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
To make you scream
And you forget your last name

Slowly
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, “Oh my god!”
I can move forever when it is with you
Dance!

Step by step, smooth and gentle
We're sticking together, little by little
You show my mouth
Your favorite places

Step by step, smooth and gentle
We're sticking together, little by little

Ich habe alte Bücher gelesen

Und Batman mit seinen Fäusten
Und natürlich sehe ich mich selbst nicht auf dieser Liste

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart

So, baby, pull me closer

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

Moved to the city in a broke-down car

But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is stay
All you have to do is stay
Just stay

All you have to do is stay a minute

Ich weiß, du willst mich nackig, nackig, nackt sehen
Ich will dein Baby, Baby, Baby sein
Drehe mich und es ist nass, als käme es aus Maytag
Sturzbetrunken von dem braunen Drink
Wenn ich so werde, kann ich nicht um dich herum sein

Denn du hast es geschlagen wie die 68er-Jets

Seni en kötü ruh haline sokmaya çalışıyorum, ah
P1 arabam senin kilise ayakkabılarından daha temiz, ah
Ona verdiğim bir nokta iki milyon dolar sadece canını yakmak içindi, ah
Tüm sahip olduğum Lamborghini'ler sadece seni kızdırmak için, ah
Bu arabaların hiçbiri kiralık değil, ah
Senin yıllık kazancını bir haftada kazanırım, ah
Birinci sürtüğüm senin liginde değil, ah
İkinci sürtüğüm de senin liginde değil, ah

Ev çok boş, ortaya bir şey lazım
Bu yüzden abanoz ağacından kesilmiş, yirmi bin dolarlık bir masa koydum
Bebeğim o masanın üzerinde kokainleri sıralara ayırıyor
Sonra burnu ile temizliyor, adamım, bebeğimi seviyorum
Hep paran hakkında konuşuyorsun, işitme cihazına ihtiyacın var
Benim hakkımda konuşuyorsun, üzerimde gölge göremiyorum
Tarzımı değiştirip, her şekile girerim
İçkimi yenileyip, her acıyı dindiririm

Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um

Her gün zencinin teki beni sınamaya çalışıyor, ah
Her gün zencinin teki sonumu getirmeye çalışıyor, ah
Roadster SV arabamın içindeyim kenara çekmişim, ah
Ceplerim aşırı dolu ağırlaşıyor, ah
Kralın peşinden geliyorsun, bu senin için çok uzun bir mesafe, ah
Ben hayata sonbaharda gelirim, ah

Legend of the fall yılı tıpkı bir eşkiya gibi ele geçirdi
Anneme yeni bir ev ve yepyeni bir Mercedes aldım
O markete gidince savurgan duruyor
Arabamın Star Trek II'deki gibi bir tavanı var
Kızlar bu şarkıyı duyduklarında kendinden geçiyorlar
Hız göstergesindeki 100 beni Tanrı'ya daha da yakınlaştırıyor
Biz aşk için dua etmeyiz, sadece arabalar için dua ederiz

Been sittin' eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like it's no point hopin' at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I'm sittin' eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, oh

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you somethin', but you gave me nothin'
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (Fit, babe) wherever (Wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

Until you come back home

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever

Ich hatte einen Traum
Wir tranken Whiskey pur
Höchstes Stockwerk, die Bowery
Nirgendwo ist es hoch genug
Irgendwo entlang der Linien
Wir stoppten, als wir uns in die Augen sahen
Du bist die ganze Nacht draußen gewesen
Und ich hatte genug

Nein, ich will es nicht wissen
Wo du gewesen bist oder wo du hingehen wirst
Aber ich weiß, ich werde nicht Zuhause sein
Und du wirst alleine sein

Wer wird dich
Durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?
Wer wird dich hin und her schaukeln
Wenn die Sonne dich nicht schlafen lässt?
Wer steht auf, um dich nach Hause zu fahren
Wenn du betrunken und alleine bist?
Wer wird dich
Durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?

Ich bin's nicht

Ich bin's nicht

Ich hatte einen Traum
Wir waren wieder 17
Sommernächte und Die Libertines
Niemals älter werden
Ich werde mitnehmen:
Die Polaroids und die Erinnerungen
Aber du weißt, ich werde gehen
Das schlechteste hinter uns lassen

Wer wird dich
Durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?
Wer wird dich hin und her schaukeln
Wenn die Sonne dich nicht schlafen lässt?
Wer steht auf, um dich nach Hause zu fahren
Wenn du betrunken und alleine bist?
Wer wird dich
Durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?

Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins (Wer kann es verstehen? Wouh)
Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren

Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will heute einfach sterben
Ich will einfach sterben
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will einfach sterben
Und lass mich dir sagen warum

All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft
Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts
Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen
Ich hatte nie einen Ort, den ich mein Eigen nennen konnte
Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause
Keiner ruft mein Handy an
Wo warst du? Wo bist du? Was geht in dir vor?
Sie sagen jedes Leben ist wertvoll, doch interessiert sich für meins

Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins (Wer kann es verstehen? Wouh)
Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren

Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Du musst heute nicht sterben
Du musst nicht sterben
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Du musst heute nicht sterben
Jetzt lass mich dir sagen warum

Es ist der erste Atemzug
Wenn dein Kopf im Wasser untergegangen ist
Und die Leichtheit in der Luft
Wenn du da bist
Brust zu Brust mit einem Geliebten
Es ist Weitermachen, auch wenn der Weg lang ist
Und Licht in den dunkelsten Dingen zu sehen
Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst
Endlich zu wissen wer es ist
Ich weiß, dass du Gott danken wirst, dass du es getan hast

Ich weiß wo du warst, wo du bist, wohin du gehst
Ich wieß, dass du der Grund bist, warum ich ans Leben glaube
Was ist der Tag mit einer kleinen Nacht?
Es kann schwer sein
Es kann so schwer sein
Aber du musst jetzt leben
Du musst jetzt alles geben

Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins (Wer kann es verstehen? Wouh)
Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will heute nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben

Schmerz tut nicht so weh, ich weiß
Die Spur, die ich fahre, fühlt sich einsam an
Aber ich bewege mich bis meine Beine aufgeben
Und ich sehe meine Tränen im Schnee schmelzen
Aber ich will nicht weinen
Ich will nicht mehr weinen
Ich will mich lebendig fühlen
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben
Oh ich will nicht
Ich will nicht

D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit

Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing

Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis

Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up

Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

She's got to save him
Αυτη εχει ως σκοπο να τον σωσει

Daily struggle
Καθημερινα παλευει

She tells him, ""Ooh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love
Αυτη του λεει, ουχ, αγαπη μου, κανενας ποτε δεν προκειται να σε πληγωσει, αγαπη μου
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Εγω προκειται να σου δωσω ολη μου την αγαπη
Nobody matters like you.""
Κανενας δεν νοιαζεται οπως εσυ

Stay up there, stay up there
Μεινε εκει που εισαι, μεινε εκει που εισαι

She tells him, ""Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life."" (Straight!)

Μεσα στο λαθος μπαρ, δεν προκειται να τον βρεις πουθενα
Steadily you work flow, everything you know

So you nah stop, no time–no time for your jeer
Ετσι εσυ δεν μπορεις σταματησεις, δεν εχεις χρονο, δεν εχεις χρονο πολλες φορες

Προσπαθει να τον κρατησει ζεστο
Trying to keep out the cold
Προσπαθει να διωξει το κρυο
When he looks in her eyes
Οταν αυτος κοιταζει μεσα στα ματια της
He don't know he is safe
Αυτος δεν ξερει οτι ειναι ασφαλης
When she says, ""Ooh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love
Οταν εκεινη του λεει, οοχ, αγαπη μου, κανενας δεν προκειται ποτε να σε βλαψει, αγαπη μου
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Εγω προκειται να σε προστατευσω αγαπη μου

Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
Or we could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh, until it falls, won't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I've been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA

I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head

I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA

See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead Redemption, scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine, on sale motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At twenty-nine, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say


I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate

Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith

Muñeca en muñeca, una conexión de encantos, sí
Acostado, seguimos siendo una conexión aparte

Miro mis diamantes mientras salgo de mi nave espacial
Necesitas tu información, tomate unas vacaciones a Malasia (Información)
Tú eres mi chica, los paparazzi se están volviendo locos
Se tragó la botella mientras yo me sentaba y fumaba el helado
Camino en mi mansión, veinte mil en la pintura, Picasso
Las perras se sumergen, se tocan con negros como un nacho
Se quitó las panties, los diamantes bailan como Rick Ricardo
Ella lo tiene, fue a la universidad, trabajó en su licenciatura
Sé que tienes un pasado, tengo un pasado, eso está por detrás de nosotros
Promedio, haré un millón en promedio (M)
Estoy manejando sin cerebro, perra, estoy fuera de sí (Skrr)

What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close? What if I lean in

What if the sky falls (Sky falls)

We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'

¡Oye!
Bueno, nada nunca dura para siempre, no
Un minuto estás aquí y al siguiente ya no
Así que, te respeto, quieres ir despacio
Necesito un recibo mental para saber que este momento me pertenece

¿Te importa si te robo un beso? -¡Vamos!- (Chop, chop)
Un pequeño recuerdo, ¿te lo puedo robar?
Para memorizar la forma en que me conmocionaste
La forma en que te movías (Hey)
Solo quiero sentirlo de ti (Hey)

No tengas miedo a enamorarte
Conduce un descapotable y persigue emociones (Hey)
Sé que no tienes miedo de esto (Hey)
Bebé, sé que no tienes miedo a enamorarte
Enamorarte de mí

Soy tu ""quiero y no puedo"", adicto a tu amor, oh
Llevo puestas tus gafas, realidad virtual
No es lo que te han costado, puede que haya sido un dólar
Siempre y cuando haga que te sacudas, memoria, electricidad

¿Te importa si te robo un beso? -¡Vamos!- (Chop, chop)
Un pequeño recuerdo, ¿te lo puedo robar? (Oh, sí)
Para memorizar la forma en que me conmocionaste (Zap)
La forma en que te movías (Hey)
Solo quiero sentirlo de ti (Hey)

No tengas miedo a enamorarte (Ha)
Conduce un descapotable y persigue emociones (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
Sé que no tienes miedo de esto (Hey)
Bebé, sé que no tienes miedo a enamorarte (Inmediatamente)
Enamorarte de mí (Woah)

Maldita sea, sé que te encanta hacer una entrada triunfal
¿Te gusta que te paguen o que te presten atención?
Mezclaste a los tipos equivocados con buenas intenciones
En la misma cama, pero aún parece que hay una larga distancia
Ella está buscando algo más de consistencia
Pero cuando dejas de buscar, vas a encontrar lo que estaba destinado a ser
Y sinceramente, estoy muy harto de las putas
Me he desecho de todas mis ex por tus besos y abrazos
Creo que mis viejas aventuras amorosas me estaban simplemente preparando
Cuando digo que te quiero, di tú lo mismo, periquito
Volamos en primera clase por el aire, Airbnb
Soy lo mejor que has tenido, solo me estarías comparando conmigo mismo
Te voy a enviar esto por email, si te pongo en mi teléfono
Y lo subo, recibiré el número máximo de reproducciones
Vine cruzando dificultades con los labiales y los teléfonos
Llevo tu colonia favorita solo para tenerte a solas

No tengas miedo a enamorarte
No tengas miedo a enamorarte
Conduce un descapotable y persigue emociones (Yeah)
Sé que no tienes miedo de esto (Lo sé)
Bebé, sé que no tienes miedo a enamorarte
Woah, woah, woah
No tengas miedo a enamorarte (No, no)
No tengas miedo, bebé

Hadn't had a good time since you know when
Got talked into goin' out with hopes you were stayin' in
I was feelin' like myself for the first time in a long time
Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

A Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
