Go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardí like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, then the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed, hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey, nigga, roll that weed up (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A., they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now shawty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Rubbed)

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryna pull me back, right?
When my joint get to bumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, ""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Hahahaha)

Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither, nigga

Part two
It's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)

When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch)

You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes, sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla

I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this

There's another world inside of me that you may never see

I-I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I-I
I can't be no more, no
Since you went away, I don't really feel like talking (No)
No one here to love me (No), baby, do you understand me?
I can't do a thing without you

It's been too long and I'm lost without you
Tell what I'm gonna do?
Said I've been needing you (Yeah), wanting you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes (Yeah)
I miss you (Baby)

What am I gonna do?

Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you

Livin' my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her (Ooh-ooh)

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)

I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone, my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were comin' home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away (Drink you away)
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home (Ooh-ooh)
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

I just called to say I love you
Come back home

¿Cómo puedes ver dentro de mis ojos
Como si fueran puertas abiertas?
Llevándote dentro de mis entrañas
Donde me he vuelto tan insensible

Sin una alma (Alma)
Mi espíritu está durmiendo en algún lugar frío
Hasta que lo encuentres ahí y lo lleves de vuelta a casa

(Despiértame) Despiértame por dentro
(No puedo despertar) Despiértame por dentro
(Sálvame) Llama por mi nombre y sálvame de la oscuridad
(Despiértame) Ordena a mi sangre que corra
(No puedo despertar) Antes de que quede deshecha
(Sálvame) Sálvame de la nada en la que me he convertido

Ahora que sé lo que me falta
No puedes simplemente dejarme (No)
Respira sobre mí y hazme real (Hazme real)
Tráeme (Tráeme) a (A) la vida

(Despiértame) Despiértame por dentro
(No puedo despertar) Despiértame por dentro

Tráeme a la vida

Tráeme a la vida

Congelada por dentro (Congelada por dentro)
Sin tus caricias (Sin tus caricias), sin tu amor
Cariño, solo tú (Solo tú)
Eres la vida entre los muertos

Todo este tiempo, no puedo creer que no haya podido ver
Oculto en la oscuridad, pero tú estabas ahí enfrente de mí
Parece que llevo mil años durmiendo
Tengo que abrir mis ojos a todo
Sin un pensamiento, sin una voz, sin alma
No me dejes morir aquí
Debe haber algo más
Tráeme a la vida

(Despiértame) Despiértame por dentro
(No puedo despertar) Despiértame por dentro

Where you from? Turn around; who you came with?
Is that your ass or your mama half reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys
But now I'm on the hook and so I'm running with Bad Boy
Here come another man, unlike no other man
Candy coated (what!) switching every other lane
Lord help me, why don't cha please help me?

13,14,"""21 Questions""",50 Cent featuring Nate Dogg,"1 ContributorRap Critic Reviews: “21 Questions” by 50 Cent feat. Nate Dogg LyricsHi, I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Ja Rule. Now, as previously stated in another episode, Ja Rule was the biggest rapper out for a while in the early 2000's. Platinum records, features, number one singles, babes, bucks, Ja Rule had it all. But, as time went on, people noticed a pattern with him, which was the constant usage of the ""thugs need love too"" formula to make hit songs, and for a long time, he was on top with it. Hit song after hit song, his ""pop gangster"" persona was blowing up, but then, there came a man who saw fit to call out this ""pop rapper"" for what he felt that he was: ""a studio thug"" who purely used his hardcore image to appeal to a female audience. That man was Mr. Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent. He'd call out Ja for not being a heartless thug, and instead being a punk, a softie! *footage of 50 calling out Ja* Sure, there's some origin about 50's friend stealing his chain and Ja Rule seeing that dude and 50 hanging out, but the main thing that people heard about was 50 calling him out for being a fake gangster, and sure enough, when 50 cent came into prominence, he would stamp out all of Ja Rule's club songs and love song, and replace them with… *""In Da Club"" and ""21 Questions""*… with club songs and love songs… Well, to 50's credit though, he did explain himself when releasing ""21 Questions"", the love song I wanted to look at today
When asked by Dr. Dre: ""How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?""
50 Cent responded with: I’m two people. I’ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that’s not diversity, it’s necessity
And you know what, I can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you DO have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. You can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next… well, wait a minute, if that's true, Mr. I'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on Ja Rule so much when HE made love songs? What is HE not allowed to have his own dichotomy? That seems a little unfair. Reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with Kanye West, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as Kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *audio clip of ""I Line Niggas', immediately followed by 50 performing ""Love Lockdown""*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with G-Unit?
*""Rider, Part 2""*
Oh yeah, yeah…
So you see, my thing about 50 Cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that I might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, Eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, Kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. But 50 Cent? Yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh… spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because… THAT'S what everyone was waiting for!
But i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe I should give him a chance. After all, it's not just making a ""thugs need love too"" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a BAD song that makes me not like one, so let's check out ""21 Questions"" by 50 cent, and see how it fares
*intro*
Oh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. Okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?
*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*
*Laugh* Yes, I echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money
*police arrive*

Oh no, the cops! Maybe making all those songs in which I publicly admit to selling crack wasn't such a good idea!
*cops come in, song starts*
*video shows 50 riding in the back of an cop van*
""New York City! You are now riding… with 50 Cent!
Well, according to this video, you're riding in the back of a cop van. I wouldn't exactly call that your finest hour
You gotta love it!
Personally, I think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks, but whatever
I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 745
I just wanna let you know before this love song starts that I'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars!
Girl, it's easy to love me now
And, of course, 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to Isaac Hayes, Mr. Nate Dogg on the hook
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

And I gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of ""i'm a thug, and you're my main bitch"". Instead of just that, it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money. He wants someone who's interested in more than money… despite what the intro may lead you to believe
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
And he starts off by asking directly: if all of his fame was over tomorrow, would you still care about him? It's straight up and to the point. And I wish he would have started with this instead of the ""riding in my car, smoking weed"" nonsense
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
You know, for most ""thugs need love too"" songs, they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship, but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years, that requires some reflection. And the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
Also, factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times, this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
Okay, that's kinda vague. You might want to elaborate what you mean, because, you know, one might confuse...
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
Okay, no confusion here, you're asking her to help you kill somebody. Got it
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
Yeah, he's asking questions about how you feel INSIDE, specifically about being an accomplice to murder

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?
Would that be before or AFTER you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder?
Are you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Uh… does that count as one of the questions? Because now it sounds like you're trolling her. You mad I'm asking' you 21 questions? Yo mad, bruh?
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
Now THIS is a deep question, and the wording is important. Do you TRUST me enough to reveal your inner aspirations, the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations, or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night, the ones that reoccur and haunt her, the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears, joys, and---
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
…and… and that was a bad transition. I don't even think that was a question, you just said, ""Baby, tell me about the intricate inner workings of THAT apple bottom ASS… also, ya dreams, and shit...
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
Okay, this couplet always throws me off, no matter how much credit I try to give this song. Listen to the whole thing
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
Yeah, this always got to me. He says, ""If someone saw me with another girl, NOT if someone just told her he was with another girl, and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened, no, IF IT WAS TRUE that he was with another women and someone told you about it, will you believe him when he says it wasn't him."" To be clear, part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you.. And what's oddly worse is that, after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example, he shifts the problems of the relationship back on HER
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
Yes, 50 Cent's girlfriend: after lying and cheating on you, it's clearly YOU who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship!
Yeah, these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it. Not the gangsterism's, not the singing intro by 50 cent, not even the line about cake and fat kids
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
You know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile
Yeah, it's corny, but by itself, it's kinda endearing, because in relationships, you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other, and in the context of a song, if you don't overdo it, it can be fitting, but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics, and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals, and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet, but in this specific hypothetical situation, he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up, succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling
We're only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you lil a fat kid loves cake
And THAT'S what makes this line bad to me: in this instance, after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship, he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go, and that just doesn't gel well with me
Overall, though, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. Never underestimate the power of Nate Dogg's vocals, my friends. And in addition, 50 Cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships, and for about 80% of it, it's relatable and understandable. Yes, it has parts that turn me off of it, but I say in the end, this songs gets a pass from me. And to his credit, at least he didn't pull a Ja Rule, *play ""Always On Time""* and make a quote unquote ""love song"" that, in a sickening revelation, was ultimately just about a pimp-ho relationship. No, 50 Cent was pretty upfront when he made THAT song
*""Cause I' m a mothefuckin' P.I.M.P.!""*

Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love…
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?

It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

'Cause I'm good holding down my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)

All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)

Now, shawty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid

Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small

Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch

I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the '90s into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave. shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you

Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh

What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it

I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary and VS dipped Jesuses
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted

But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya

I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger

We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend

I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride
But shorty, there's somethin' you provide

What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

Tell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss
And boom, you're the only one for me

So please tell me why
Don't you come around no more?

A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain

It's all in the game of love

Sunshine instead of this cold lonely sea
So, please, baby, try

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

You better lose yourself in the music

From that moment on I knew you were the one, yeah
(I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love)
We would sit and talk for hours about anything
(Baby, you hang up, no, you hang up, on three hang up)
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything

How you gonna change it up, we just finished makin' up?

How you gonna trip, how could you forget
How you gonna act like that

Girl, I never thought that lovin' you would hurt
(I did everything a good man would to make it work)
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts
(Like before I put the down on the house we bought)
Now I'm thinkin' you and me was a mistake

I messed around and gave up everything
I thought we'd never part (Yes, I did, baby)
I was a player and made the choice to give my heart to you
And I gotta keep it that way, ooh, baby

I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around

This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I damn near shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; may niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
Now Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph, especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, which the clear sole
But it's Timb's and fat laces when it's cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit' them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho'
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin' in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin' dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin' dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin' them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wildin') fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

Now in the box is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (peep mine)
Rock em once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes

Made a CD and then he hit the block

Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome

Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, mmm
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne

So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said, ooh, she fell in love

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Misguided heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love

So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open this door)
Surprise, it's time (Yeah)
To feel what's real, what's real
What happened to Miss Independent? (Oh)
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)
When love, when love is true

When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""Why can't that be me?""
I'm so glad I finally see

What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Oh yeah)
Surprise (Surprise), it's time (Yeah)
To feel (To feel) what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive (Yeah)

I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake from the words that are said

I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me

And I'm
Calling all angels
And I'm

While private eyes solve marriage lies 'cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens (I won't give up if you don't give up)

In a world that what we want (I won't give up if you don't give up)

Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say?

Lift me up in your eyes

Well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart

And we'll fly

This is the night where we capture forever
And all our tomorrows begin
After tonight, we will never be lonely again

You got this room for two

Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and

Swim in a deep sea of blankets

This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets

My stomach's filled with the butterflies

Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud

If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again""
So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in""

When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down

Right about the same time you walk by

You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL
Buy some red wine, a little Gaja 9-7
You're so contagious, I can't take it
This is for the grown and sexy, uhh
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second?
(You're so foxy, girl) 'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be hanging with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come, hang with me? (Ooh, oh)
Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?

You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma, I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, all trust
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport (Nah), I call it the clearport (Woo)
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!

Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!

'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun, 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV, like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful – some men be
Rapists – so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so?
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know?
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men, and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – be–fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from Black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money, it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander The Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with Black faces
Shot up they nose, to impose, what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive, until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king!
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen!""

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same

And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

An ass like that gotta be one of a kind (Woo)
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
The Ds ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'

Now shorty think I'ma sweat her (Uh-huh), sippin' on Amaretto (Yeah)
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her

By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat

But it's July

I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day

Pour me somethin' tall an' strong

Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone’s for me
You can tell 'em I just sailed away

And pour me somethin' tall an' strong

Mm

So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Whoa)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)

Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)

So, what, am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
Now I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)(Yeah)

""Never can, never will, can't hold us down"" (Check it)

Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'

Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack

And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most

The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea

Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love

And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that, I still loved You

I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more

Begging, ""God, please to send you back to me""

You made me feel like I could not breathe, when I
All I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love (Give you all my love)

I can't believe it, four years go down the drain
Oh, how I wish things would have happened so differently
I tried to save us so many times, but still, you couldn't see
You kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

You and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up, face reality
It all just seem too good to be true after all you put me through

And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight

It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets

78,79,"""Fighter""",Christina Aguilera,"42 ContributorsFighter Lyrics“Fighter” is a song recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera for her fourth studio album, Stripped. The song was released as the third single from the album.
Hm
After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you (Ooh)
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, oh

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, uh-huh, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Oh)
It makes me that much wiser (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Ha, a fighter)
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

You thought I would forget, thought I, I remember (Oh)
'Cause I remember (Oh)
I remember
You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)
I remember (Oh-ooh)
'Cause I remember (Oh)
I remember

Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter","pop, female vocalists, soul, rnb, dance"

Here’s Tupac’s original song.

and Colio’s
Shit, tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... at thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

[Hook}
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm coming from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream, ""Peace,"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion


Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion","rap, Hip-Hop, Gangsta Rap, West Coast Rap, hip hop"

I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road

Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold

It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car

Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers

Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right

Going where the night might lead

But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead

But what was I thinking... what was I thinking","country, modern country, dierks bentley, male vocalists, male country"

Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

But for me, it's waking up beside you, yeah
To watch the sun rise on your face
To know that I can say ""I love you""
At any given time or place, oh

It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine, all mine
And it's the flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

You're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy it brings

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problemed child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, durags, and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)

Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Uh-huh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great (Ugh)
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So, I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b'
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Bitch)

(Come on) Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think this shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Haha)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can—

Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away","rap, Hip-Hop, hip hop, Eminem, pop"

But I say there's some things worth fightin' for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep em' by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in
Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend
Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right
Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I'v been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for
Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?!","country, Darryl Worley, male country, modern country, soft rock"

I've been up to my neck working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreaming of gettin' away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico

No shoes, no shirt and no problems
Blues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt and no problems
No problems

Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Wanna look through my shades and see you there with me
Wanna soak up life for a while in laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt and no problems
Blues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom

And this the things I get shorty?

I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to

On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we wanna go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone


And on, I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on
