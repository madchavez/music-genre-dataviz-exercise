If I should stay
I would only be in your way

I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I want to stay

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)

It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone

Ain't nothin' but a ""G"" thang, baby

Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand

Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke

Yo, please, some fries with that shake
See, many terms are used to relate

Where I'm from, they call 'em Dukies

Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath, it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be

With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

Sittin' over here, starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes, sure don't give a damn
And ya don't know that I've been dreamin'
Of ya in my fantasy
Never once you looked at me
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you to fulfill my needs
Think what you want, let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to

How many nights I've laid in bed excited over you?
I've closed my eyes and thought of us a hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times, I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day, all I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time 'cause we've got all night, ooh
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like, if you like, I'll go
Down, da-down, down, down, da-down, down
I'll hold you in my hand and maybe

Your smooth and shiny feels so good against my lips, sugar
I want you so bad I can taste your love right now, baby

It was influenced by, among other things, Woody Guthrie and La Siesta del Martes.
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow, I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just a-drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow, I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there


Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away, but it always seems the same","alternative rock, rock, Grunge, alternative, 90s"

I hear you're taking the town again
Having a good time
With all your good time friends
I don't think that you think of me
You're on your own now
And I'm alone and free

I know that I should get on with my life
But a life lived without you could never be right

As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me

I try to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody that I was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away (Won't go away)
Loneliness found me
Looks like it's here to stay

I know that I ought to find someone new
But all I find is myself always thinkin' of you

As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me

Oh, no matter what I do
Each night's a lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this, I need your touch
And you're the only one I've ever loved, oh


And as long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea

Another phat, phat track, so Rhythm D, pour the orange juice
And let's relax while sippin' on 'gnac because it's like that
I'm cautious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic
I wear a jimmy for the skinny that's in the long trench
Front row seats, so yo I know she's on the nine inch
Just to get a piece of the green, but she's an undertaker
Not knowin' the paper is a 'round the world heart-breaker
Many say I front, but yo, had to have a break down
Playin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round
Takin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, take me to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your woman, G
'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me
It make a man say 'damn'
I'm finally taxin' more than your homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is held up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this grip in ninety-two
And you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And uh, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagara
Think before you step, because these lyrics just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold D's on my four and gold 'lex, 'cause I got it made
I broke the veto once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track, and yo, any way is OK

Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Now here we go from the top, second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, hoes should be happy for the ding-dong
And since a man clock a grip, G
It's like every nigga that I see be like, 'Do you remember me?'
A hustler, and it's known with more hoes than Lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so niggas leggo my Eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
And pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with a chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin'
So hide his eyes when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh

Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Now here we go, uh, let's take a trip to another land
Clock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the Lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like 'What's up with ya? You ain't heard a damn thing'
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'Cause doin' the Ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Kick the kind of style that knock the funk off of Fritos
Make you man jealous while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the pipe with concern-and
I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And don't disagree and then jock, that's a pity
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the Ditty

And it can only be seen (Only be seen)

Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will our memories survive? One I can hold on to

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

In fact, no brotherman - here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall

Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you

For the morning sun and all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort, too

Somehow, you make it better

Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still, I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?

Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now, pride's gone out the window, 'cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?

If the shoe fits
I want you to wear it and wear it good

Talking 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be looking for somebody else
But, as time went on, I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

And so, you call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

Friends and enemies around me every day
I can't believe half the things they say
Taking me for granted giving no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncing like a bouncing ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me
Can't trust no one as far, as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall
Listening to my friends talk about it all

You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Sons of Soul, y'all

I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -

When I need somebody there's nobody to call
When they need me, my phone rings off the wall
But these are my friends, and that's what they say
Constantly taking from me every day
You say...

You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

You call me your friend

And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)

Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

I've become blind
I've become what I know not breathes
You seem illiterate to all my emotions
I stand corrected, how well you read
You speak the truth, you speak to me
You feel the love I have yet to find
I know it's there, I know it's there
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
Pathetic me, I long to be you
I think I'm close but I stand so far
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
I miss the love only cause they starve
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
I life and death my way through the sun
Where originates all the pain that leaves
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you

Well define my love with attitude
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
You can always tell
But I know remorse so well
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason

I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides

I hope you look at me through patient eyes

How I long to contradict those vibes
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
It's not the love and I quest the why
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
The fear of pity is always awake
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
It's the windows, the doors
The passageways to the truth
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
In total recall as wild as the deuce
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
So superficial is the open wound
I caress the infinite light
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you

Well, define my love, that lives within you
Even when I die, it will sing to you
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason

Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie

Mine immaculate dream
Made breath and skin, I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you
(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces)
Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry

Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?

Words, playing me déjà vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chills, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry

Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?

Who do you need? Who do you love
When you come undone?

Oh, like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon
It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere and we both know why
But me, I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending, I can't live this life

I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking, babe
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me?
It seems to me that lately (Seems to me that lately)
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry
Could it be that maybe (Could it be that maybe)

Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more

It only stands in our way
We had to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart

Don't care now who's to blame

I'm lickin' down your darlin' in every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way
This ain't got shit to do with shampoo, but watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit
Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom, ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what you're thinkin', 'cause I'm vampin'

Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho 'round

You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'

I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way

One reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what you heard 'cause I ain't bailin' no hay
Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
Don't know me? Don't come around!
Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat 'em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof

She leads a lonely life
Oh, she leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
""Oh, what a morning""
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get ya

All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time
So don't cry
One day all seven will die

All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time
So don't cry
One day all seven will die

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand, she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet (One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four)
But behold, we will watch them fall
And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us, animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love, only blasphemy
And in the distance, six others will curse me
But that's all right (That's all right)
For I will watch them fall
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven)

All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect (Huh), and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time
So don't cry
One day all seven will die
(Just how old?)

And we will see a plague and a river of blood (Ah)
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
Their seven tears, but do not fear
For in the distance, twelve souls from now
You and me will still be here
We will still be here
There will be a new city with streets of gold (Ah-ah-ah)
The young so educated, they never grow old
And, uh, there will be no death for with every breath
The voice of many colors sings a song that's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall

All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir faire
No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time

Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stomping on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back 'cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key

You trip with me, now it's a must that I trip with you

Well, here's a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like
I heard she was a 'Frisco dyke
But on the rizzeals, I'm talking about you and me

Your bark was loud but your bite wasn't vicious
And them rhymes you were kickin' were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg? ""Oh, is he crazy?""
With your mama and your daddy hollering ""Baby!""
So won't they let you know
That if you step with Dre, fool, you're step wit Death Row
And I ain't even swangin' them thangs

Gap teeth in your mouth so my gat's gots to fit

While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not understand me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gonna creep to South Central

Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat

Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

And lay you down

Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take's on my way home

Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true

And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah


Now as you close your eyes, know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses

Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
""I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys""
""See you later. Can I have them, please?""

I called him up just the other day
""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time""
""You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu""
""But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

What, what about your friends?
What about
What about your friends?
What about your
What about your
What about your

Every now and then, I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before, then you're still down with me, yeah

What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you?

Well, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too friendly
So, to speak, hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy, which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy

Every now and then, I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see, I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true, they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again? (Oh-oh, whoa)
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)

I wouldn't change, not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me

It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be, oh!

I got a question to ask you, troop
Are you a chef? 'Cause you keep feedin' me soup
You know what they say about those who sweat theyself
You might find yourself, by yourself

That just came home from jail, sweatin' you for a date?
I don't want no beef, I just wants to get together!
By how you talkin'? Pssssh! Whatever!
We can't have nothin'? It all depends
Well, if we can't be lovers, then we can't be friends
Well, then I guess it's nothin'
Well, hey! I think you're bluffin'!
Well, I'mma call my man
Well, I can get raggamuffin!
You better catch a flashback — remember, I'm not crabbin' it

You can't get a girl like me with a line like this
Well, look, I'll treat you good
My man treats me better
I'll talk sweet on the phone
My man writes love letters
I'll tell ya that I want ya, and tell ya that I care
My man says the same, except he's sincere
Well, I'm clean, cut and dapper — that's what I'm about
My man buys me things and he takes me out
Well, you can keep your man 'cause I don't go that route!

You say that I'm number one
And you'll always be true
How can this be?
You say you've fallen in love
You don't know what it means
But look around and you will see
Broken promises and jealousy
Is that what you should want for us to be?
One time lover turned enemy
But that's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying
That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go
All I can say is that
I'm looking no further ahead than today
Too young for this game
On the road to forever we don't know the way
So just forget about eternity
All the promises we just can't keep
Look down any street that's what you'll see
I don't wanna bring you to your knees

But that's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying
That's what love can do, oh no

To face the truth, face the truth

I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my
Mind

""How can I be strong?"" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions, you had many
I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you
Ooh, it felt so good and
Ooh, so right

""How can I be strong?"" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
I don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go

Say you love me

The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

When all of my hopes were dyin'
Her love kept me tryin'
But she does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once, I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her lovin' eyes

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time

Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog (Damn)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out (What's up?)
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', ""Domino""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.​ 
Today was a good day (Shit)

Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun (Yeah)
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out (Uh)
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK

You ain't got to be so blind
But I'm blind
So very blind

Can't you see what I am

And it goes a little something like this - hit it

Can love him once but not twice
Who plays games with no rules (A fool)
Tears for fears (Are no surprise)
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)
Love 'em and leave 'em (Is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life

I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Oh, if he don't want ya, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose

Fact of life (So sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (Nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (Bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come

I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Just kick a little somethin' for them cars that be bumpin'
Somethin' real smooth, hahaha
You can just ride to
Tell me how you feel
Here we go...

Hold tight, hold tight, say we haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, say we haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kris Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis
(Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, see...)
The bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school, and I passed
No moms trippin', so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac
I says ""I am what I am, that's who I be""
And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright

Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kris Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids tryna be like me...
(With the braids, the shades, some pants and some Nikes, G)
And nothin' mo' better then a letter sayin'
""I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?"" Yesssss!
I try not to pass on the autograph
I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood
And ain't nobody dissin' sayin' that nigga thinks he's too good
Cause I'm down like four flat tires
(Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj)
Showin' I can do right and not do wrong
Representin' the BG's and comin' up strong, and...
(We ain't got no love for the other side)
We only love those who love us back, right?

Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kris Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast
Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know, really though
The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
Early mornin' interviews then we step to school
Step from school, back to interviews then it's on to other dues
So, warm it up Chris?
I said ""Ya warm it up Chris?""
That's what I was gonna do!

Now throw your hands in the air, wave from side-to-side
If the feelin' thatcha feelin', is a feelin' that's right
See, I ain't come out wack I came out right
Unlike those moles who chose to ""Pass Da Mic""
It's the Daddy Mac (Big baby!)
Everything is real but you wanna diss cause a nigga sold a couple mill
(Look here...) Ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line
So when you diss it just lets me know I'm on your mind, and it's alright

Hold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight
It no matter if you’re black, it no matter if you’re white
Just come in de house make we all unite
Tell dem Kris Kross and dem a drop on de mic and make we dance until the morning light
Tell dem Kris Kross a de people’s choice we haffi dance until de day light
Your girl inna de place and your hold her tight and dance to the people’s choice
Tell dem Kris Kross dem a tear down de mic, dance hard cause the vibes is right

Why don't you sit right back
And I, I may tell you a tale
A tale of three little pigs
And a big bad wolf

Well the first little piggy, well he was kinda hick-y
Spent most of his days just a-dreamin' of the city
And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood to become a star
But living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity
Then one day, jammin' on some chords
Along came the wolf knocking on his door

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

Well the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoned
He spent most of his time just a-ganja smokin'
Hoppin' and a-boppin' down on Venice Beach
Getting paid money for religious speech
Built his shelter from what he garbage picked
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks
Then one day he was cranking up Bob Marley
Along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

Well the third little piggy, the grade A student
His daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent
Earned his Master's degree from Harvard College
Built his house from his architect knowledge
A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills
Daddy's rock stardom paid for the bills
Then one day came the old house smasher
The big bad wolf, the little piggy slasher

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in

Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in!

Well the big bad wolf
Well he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could
And lo and behold, the little piggy's house stood
""It's made out of concrete,"" the little piggy shouted
The wolf just frowned as he pouted
So they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would
They sent out Rambo, just as fast as they could

""Yo, Wolf-face. I'm your worst nightmare. Your ass is mine!""
(gunshots)

Well the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
And that's the end of this story, for you and me
If you still give a listen, you just may
Hear the big wolf or little piggies say

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Well I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in

You can see I'm in no shape for driving

You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You would say I lost my sense of direction
Yes, you could say all of this and worse but

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You would say I lost my belief in our politicians
They all seem like game show hosts to me

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a - a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first

Walk away if you want to
It's ok, if you need to
You can run, but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)

And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind

Take the time
To think about it
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire that's burning up inside me

But you can't have it all
