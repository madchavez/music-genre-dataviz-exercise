When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand?
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah)

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn (Yeah), let it burn (Ooh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through (Yeah)
Let it burn (Let it burn, woah), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now, it's too late
I know she ain't comin' back
What I gotta do now (Now) to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to (Oh)
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't (Cause the party ain't)
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)

Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through (Know it's through)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn (Ooh, girl, I)

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But, see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one, pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop—there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)
So ""click it or ticket,"" let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling

Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well, I was looking at them, there, there, on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
'Specially the big girl
Big girls need love, too—no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male-friend boyfriend was boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail – on the low, ho

Uh, yeah, uh, yo

I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York, shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P. section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla, to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, ""That's what's up!""
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

Yeah (Can you hear me?)
Bronx, BX borough, Terror Squad, uh
Big Pun forever, Tone Montana forever, uh (Can you hear me?)
Yeah, streets is ours, come on
Nah man, it ain't never gon' stop

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and this nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun

Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish

Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two, oh, oh)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions

Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, ""One second, baby, please hear me""

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh, I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

I'm a dick thrower, her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get off me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark, let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

It's like I got the world in my palms
Your girl up under my arms, she fucked up from the charm
She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 'til early in the morn'
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth, baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?

Kanye, es Foxx, hombre
Solo digo que estaba hablando con las chicas, ya sabes
Y no ponemos suficiente énfasis en las damas en algún momento
Sabes, estaba hablando con esta chica
Ella estaba hablando de la música todo rápido en el club, ¿sabes?
Ella tiene que beber agua porque tiene sed
Ella bailó como 9200 canciones seguidas
Con nadie realmente trata de averiguar lo que siente
Cómo se sientе, ya sabes, ¿sabes lo que mе dijo?
(Vas a serlo) Compruébalo, esto es lo que dijo
(Di que vas a serlo) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh

Ella dijo que quería algo de Marvin Gaye, algo de Luther Vandross
Una pequeña Anita definitivamente hará que esta fiesta comience bien
(Vas a serlo, vas a serlo, vas a serlo
Vas a serlo, vas a serlo, bien bien bien bien)
Ella dijo que quiere algo de Ready for the World, algo de New Edition
Un poco de Minnie Riperton definitivamente hará que esta fiesta comience bien
(Vas a serlo, vas a serlo, vas a serlo
Vas a serlo, vas a serlo, bien bien bien bien)

¡Definitivamente lo hará!
¿Sabes lo que le dije?

Le dije que condujera en su nuevo látigo, trajera algunos amigos, genial ingenio
Voy a traer el látigo genial, luego quiero que te desnudes
Nos vemos, eres mi nueva chica, así que nos ponemos a trabajar
Ella me está agarrando, llamándome Biggie como Shyne en casa
Hombre, te juro que tiene buenos hogares, ¿por qué siempre mientes?
Diciéndome lo de los diamantes, cuando ella sabe que son pedrería
Ella consiguió que un amigo de piel clara se pareciera a Michael Jackson
Tengo un amigo de piel oscura que se parece a Michael Jackson
Reproducí Ready for the World, ella estaba lista para algo de acción
Mi amigo dijo que no eres un bicho raro, así que vas a probar que mi hombre está equivocado
Voy a poner este Vandross, te vas a quitar los pantalones
Voy a poner esta Gladys Knight, tú y yo lo haremos bien

Ella dijo que quería algo de Marvin Gaye, algo de Luther Vandross
Una pequeña Anita definitivamente hará que esta fiesta comience bien

Arma la fiesta, realmente arma la fiesta bien
Sí lo hará, sí lo hará (Bueno bueno bueno bueno)

¡¡¡Oooh!!!
¿Qué sabes de los Isley Brothers?

Ahora Kanye, sé que te dije que lo hicieras más lento, bebé
Está bien, está todo bien, es hermoso
Pero ahora necesito que lo hagas más rápido bebé
¿Puedes por favor? ¡Hazlo más rápido, bebé, hazlo más rápido!
Diablos, nena; no puedo hacerlo tan rapido... pero conozco a alguien que puede hacerlo, Twista!

Te tengo mirando la lista en mis manos y muñecas
Mientras estoy recostado y fumando en mi Cannabis
Cuando se trata de romper el ritmo como Marvin y Luther
Puedo decirte que no te estás metiendo con Kan Man y Twist
En Chicago, bebemos Hennessy, toca algo de R&B
Mientras fumo una B, preferiblemente puedes encontrar que soy un G
Y todo es (Bien bien bien bien)
Ven conmigo y bebe un poco de champán Evelyn
¿No sabes que Twista podría funcionar como los Whispers?
Presiona el semáforo, muévelo a algunos Isleys
Las llantas todavía se mueven, así que choco con un pequeño Spinner
Mientras estoy fumando en una B, sumergiéndome en las calles
Tocando R&B y tengo el calor en los 23
Y lo hago (Bien bien bien bien)
Con mi tierra en el viento fumando fuego
Déjame mojar tus sábanas escuchando a Keith Sweat
Te pondré aturdida con Maze
Cumpliendo todas nuestras tentaciones
Interferencia lenta, teniendo sexo profundo
Estás lista para la chica del mundo, vamos, ve conmigo
Te toco todo el cuerpo, nena, no me digas que no
Y cada momento estar controlándome
Me encanta la forma en que me abrazas cuando escucho a Jodeci
Y cuando vengo y doblo tu trasero
Estarás golpeando a Teddy Pendergrass
Lo golpeé por la espalda, a la melodía y lo monté lento
Ahora tengo que subir rápido, pero voy a terminar último
No importa lo matón que le veas
Todavía lo escupo como si fuera R&B, ven al club conmigo
Y cuando algo de Luther ven, espero que me sientas
Y todavía estará enamorado de mí, pasa por Chicago

How the hell'd we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed?
And try to turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists
And unpack your suitcase
Lately, there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

Nothing's wrong
Just as long
As you know that someday, I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when

Well, I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong
Just as long
As you know that someday, I will

Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that


How the hell'd we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed?
And try to turn the tables
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

Nothing's wrong

As you know that someday, I will

I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
And now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

And these wounds won't seem to heal
And this pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears

But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady on the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

And we can meet up the next day and chill

But when my plane touch down, pick me up at 8:00, don't be late

Yo, yo
The next day, I'm with the fellas at the cage playin ball
Here she come with her friends, they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin out, tryna dunk, tryna dribble
Break fast through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over, I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying, ""Lil' Howard you weak""
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, ever mess wit' it? Please don't
Told her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too
I'm like, ""Yeah boo, I can't see me without you""
Got there, I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong set, I looked at her and said

Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of Henn and we can get drunk
It's up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
'Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby, hop in, it's enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and there's nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place of a child
Don't worry, be happy and smile

There’s nothin' goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on
You got to trust me, ma

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that, with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now, I moved on
Because I realized I've got

Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that, from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that, from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

You're so controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop callin' me, come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now, I am strong
Because I realized I've got

Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend

I know that I will never disappoint myself

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

Become so tired, so much more aware

'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' 'bout
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)

Preso, não vão me deixar sair
E tive um longo dia no tribunal, essa merda me estressa
Não vão me dar fiança, não podem me tirar (Droga!)
Agora tô indo pra cadeia, tenho que cumprir minha pena aqui
Eu vivia no luxo, não quero viver aqui
A parede é cinza, a roupa é laranja
O telefone tá quebrado, a comida é um lixo
Muitos pretos estão vivendo sob essas circustâncias
Com o SP é o mesmo, ainda acabo com seus comparsas
Dinheiro de droga pra dinheiro de rap, progresso do trabalho
Os pretos vieram correndo me contar que eu devia tеr ido pro Kansas
Fui pego por tentativa de assassinato
Mе jogaram no Bloco D quando eu tava queimando um baseado
Tinha um tijolo escondido
Espero que não levem isso mais longe
Preso e não vão me deixar  sair
Quando eu chego na cela, os caras sabem que o medo acabou

Fico constantemente tentando achar um motivo (Motivo)
Por que faço o que faço? (Faço)
A liberdade não tá se aproximando (Aproximando)
Não importa o quão longe eu vá (Vá)
Meu carro é roubado (Roubado)
Sem registro (-istro)
A polícia patrulhando (Patrulhando)
E agora me pararam

E eu fico preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não vão me deixar sair
Estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não, não vão me deixar sair
Estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não vão me deixar sair
Estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não, não vão me deixar sair

Indo pro centro abastecer (Abastecer)
Volto com alguns kilos (Kilos)
A esquina tá pegando fogo (Fogo)
Infiltrados vestidos como viciados (Viciados)
Fazendo muito dinheiro (Dinheiro)
O produto circula rápido (Rápido)
Guardo o estoque
Enquanto vendo o último pacote

Fodi tudo e fui preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não vão me deixar sair
Meu mano, estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não, não vão me deixar sair
Estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não vão me deixar sair
Querida, estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não, não vão me deixar sair

Agora que estou preso, represento duas gangues
Sou matar ou morrer e fico na pegada no Bloco D
Duas escovas de dentes afiandas, pra quem quiser algo com o P
Quando ando por aí, os caras se levantam
Porque estou preso, não podem me tirar
Fumo um baseado de haze quando me estressam
Vá até o bar quando os destroços estiverem espalhados
Mal posso esperar pelo dia em que vão me deixar sair

Porque as visitas não vem mais
Parece que se esqueceram de mim
O depósito tá ficando vazio
Meus colegas de cela tão arrumando comida sem mim
Mal posso esperar pra sair
E seguir com a minha vida
(Seguir com minha vida)
Ter uma família que me ama
E que quer que eu faça o certo

Mas ao invés disso estou aqui preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não vão me deixar sair
Oh! Estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não, não vão me deixar sair
Meu mano, estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair
Não vão me deixar sair
Oh, oh, oh! Estou preso
Não vão me deixar sair

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it all falls down
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou'
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou'
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down

Runnin' your bitch faster than the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rose gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buyin' diamonds by the pair
But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin' is your hair, yea
I'm ridin' with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
A ladies man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention the boy pack clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists gettin' wrong deals

But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care about what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't puttin' no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread but I ain't spending a quarter
So cut the games ma, let's go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass 'round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm ridin' through the town

'Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""

Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me

'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be

And all the other guys just despise me because these

But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands

That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead

'Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

Look at Em, little punk ass, thinking he the shit

Wanna hold hands

Went from sold-out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?

(Through the test of time)
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye To The…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody order pancakes, I'll just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom, or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I've been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire; ha–I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make Da Band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize to everyone right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said, like, six weeks
Y'know, he had–I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror–half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds, 
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, 
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe–safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
""There's been an accident,"" like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past (Uh-huh)
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid  that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph (Uh-huh! Yeah!)
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire (Woo!)

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had to, um...
I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin...
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

Said it was necessary, these sucka niggas out here very scary
They cuffing hoes, they living in the month of February
OK then, put a sissy nigga on display then
Kick in your door and have my folks bring them K's in

It ain't a hoe out there, for real, who don't know bout me
Bitch I'm for sure with it
Don't make me pop that trunk to the 'Lac
Bitch I will go get it
And I ain't selfish, I will let you and your ho feel it
Won't catch me sipping on no Cris and got a cold belly
It's Youngbloodz A-Town malt liquor sipping
Coming straight from the gutter
Toe-tag a motherfucker, leave them under a cover

Cock back bust aim now I done got your number
In the club you gone feel it when it drop this summer
Like rain we gone pour and hit you hard like thunder
Cause in the Dirty we them boys that drank you under the table
Where them niggas pimp hoes in fly suits and gators
In my Chevy so super I'm the one to call
Just dial 1-800-430 slash ALCOHOL
And dog I'm not the one that you really just wanna clown
I'm cool in my way, but shit still I shut them down
And piss on them haters J-Bo he cuts a fool

And you gonna need more than stitches to patch that leak up

Show a nigga you ain't hoe with it
And I ain't selfish I will let you and your folk feel it

And hit you with that U-Way so look here don't be surprised

Have you always been inside waiting to breathe

Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky

Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Far away (I will)
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean

Remember when
I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when
We vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, and there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when
Old ones died and the new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when


Remember when
The sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

Remember when
Thirty seemed so old
Now looking back, it's just a stepping stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when

Remember when
We said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

I'm loving how you look in my eyes, swanging them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
She got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy

I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby

Lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my ON-LY
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MIE

I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby

I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby

I know it gon' drive you, crazy

Yeah...
Don't know what fucked me up more: watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)
Big house, big Benz – girl, it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all the night, we can have a baller night

I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving

Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Coronas - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: ""wassup?""
I told em: ""follow me"". they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing ""Right Thurr"" - he glistening""
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit

Ma showed up like ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, with a bowl of Tender Vittles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again

Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone
Up and at them bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
Yeah, I'm dressed for success
From my head down to my boots

I don't do it for money there's still bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway
Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah I'm real good under pressure, being all that I can be
And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekends been to strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long

You can bet that I stand ready when the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady, hey I'm true down to the core
And I will always do my duty, no matter what the price
I've counted up the cost, I know the sacrifice
Oh, and I don't want to die for you
But if dying's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
Cause freedom don't come free

Beside my brothers and my sisters, I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy, I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines, so sleep in peace tonight

I woke up early this morning around 4 a.m.​
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's okay
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh

Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern
Or in a honky-tonk
Or on a four-wheel-drive tailgate
Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait

Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip

'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

Victoria Secret
Well, their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing
On a Wal-Mart shelf half-price
And still look sexy (Sexy)
Just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me

You may think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door

Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls
Like me

(Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah!
(Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah!
(Hell yeah!)
I said hell yeah!","country, female vocalists, modern country, Gretchen Wilson, singer-songwriter"

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand-new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusa—
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand-new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there, someone's gonna touch my body

'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape""
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

98,99,"""Letters from Home""",John Michael Montgomery,"15 ContributorsLetters From Home Lyrics
My dearest son, it's almost June
I hope this letter catches up with you and finds you well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol'-same in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said too much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, in a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's something funny
'Bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best y'all
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night long
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring
Man on the television said something
So I couldn't sleep
But I'll be alright, I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's in a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh 'cause she calls me honey
But they take it hard, 'cause I don't read the good parts
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

Dear son, I know I ain't written
And sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me I might not have said it, so I'll say it now
Son, you make me proud

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs
'Cause there ain't nothin' funny when a soldier cries
And I just wipe my eyes
I fold it up and put in my shirt pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home","country, classic country, john michael montgomery, bluegrass, male country"
99,100,"""I Go Back""",Kenny Chesney,"15 ContributorsI Go Back Lyrics
""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back, I go back, I go back","country, Kenny Chesney, modern country, rock, pop"
