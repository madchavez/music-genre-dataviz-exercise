Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door, too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax, baby, and draw that blind

Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen up that pretty French gown
Let me pour you a good, long drink
Ooh, baby, don't you hesitate, 'cause

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be all right
'Cause I love you, girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

C'mon, angel, my heart's on fire
Don't deny your man's desire
You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside, 'cause

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be all right
'Cause I love you, girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now


Don't say a word, my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be all right
'Cause I love you, woman
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

J'ai un peu peur
Oh mon Dieu, qu'est-ce que va dire maman?
Mon amour, viens plus près, embrasse-moi
Oh, je t'adore beaucoup
Cette nuit est la nuit
Oh, oui cette nuit est la nuit
Oh, je t'aime, je t'aime, je t'aime
Cette nuit, oh

Ooh hoo
Ah, ah, ah

Love, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love

Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love

Do you think I'm such a fool to believe everything you say is true
That just goes to show
That you really don't know
While you're out paintin' the town
Do you think I'm home just sittin' around waitin' on you
Now who's really the fool
When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find
That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Why'd you slip around secretly
If you were tired of loving me
Why'd you keep holdin' on when love was already gone
The times you said you weren't feelin' well
Did you think I couldn't tell you'd been with someone else
You were only kiddin' yourself

When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find
That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light
I see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshine

Side by side, the tide rolls in

I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light

I see us with our children and our happy home
Little smiles, so warm and tender looking up at us
Blessed by love, the one we shared
Till I wake, and reach for you
And you're just not there

There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said, I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

16,17,"""Do You Wanna Make Love""",Peter McCann,"2 ContributorsDo You Wanna Make Love LyricsSometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon
Lose all their meaning with the rising moon
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true
Answer the question I must ask of you .....
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else
Take all the freedom that a lover will allow
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now
Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else

If you wanna get close to me
You could do it so easily
Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes
Or just another empty lie?
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Well, do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else","pop, male vocalists, vocal, male, baffi di un certo livello"

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave""","classic rock, rock, 70s, soft rock, country"

Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way, hey, yeah

Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Oh, its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy
Joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening

Stop this world from fighting

And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you

Do you love him
As much as I love her?
And will that love be strong
When old feelings start to stir?

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories

And if I hold you
For the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go?

Whoa, no, we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her her name
When the drinks finally hit her, she said ""I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings""

In the mirror I saw him, and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman, who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

""You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

After he left us I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field

But this time your hurting won't heal

We had to get back home
And when we opened up the door
I had to be alone

She stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies

Going through security
I held her for so long
She finally looked at me in love

He was born on a summer day, 1951
And with a slap of a hand, he had landed as an only son

His mother and father said: ""What a lovely boy?
We'll teach him what we learned, ah, yes! Just what we learned
We'll dress him up warmly and we'll send him to school
It'll teach him how to fight, to be nobody's fool""

Oh!
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?

In the summer of '53, his mother brought him a sister
And she told him: ""We must attend to her needs, she's so much younger than you""

Well, he ran down the hall and he cried
Oh! How could his parents have lied?
When they said he was their only son
He thought he was their only one

Oh!
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?
Oh! What a lonely boy?

Goodbye Mama!
Goodbye you!
Goodbye Papa!
I'm pushing on through!

He left home on a winter day, 1969
And he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time

Well, his sister grew up
And she married a man
He gave her a son
Ah, yes! A lovely son
They dressed him up warmly
They sent him to school
It taught him how to fight
To be nobody's fool

Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

You trade yours for candy after church is through

And points all her own, sittin' way up high
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues

Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime (Mmm)
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley, or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me, but neither one cared
We were gettin' our share

Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves

Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song

You were in my arms
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song

January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flame became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And it's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write


Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night (Cries for you each night)
And it's almost like a song (Almost like a song)
But it's much too sad to write
It's too sad to write","country, classic country, Ronnie Milsap, male vocalists, a little bit country"

You left me here on your way to paradise
And you pulled the rug right out from under my life
I know where you goin' to, I knew when you came home last night
'Cause your eyes had a mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Lord, I was stunned, shoulda seen it come a long time ago
When I realized, the reality gave me a roll
If things are the same, then explain why your kiss is so cold
And that mist in your eyes feels like rain on the fire in my soul

This lyin' and cryin' is upsettin' and gettin' nowhere
It don't stack up, so slack up, then pack up, I just don't care
Don't let the screen door hit you on your way out
Don't you drown when your dreamboat runs onto the ground

I'd just like to know, do you love him or just makin' time
By filling his glass with your fast-flowing bittersweet lime?
You'll face the aftertaste when you come home late some night
With your eyes all a mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Way on the other side of the Hudson
Deep in the bosom of suburbia
I met a young girl
She sang mighty fine
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria
Standing by the waterfall in Paramus Park
She was working for the friends of BAI
She was collecting quarters in a paper cup
She was looking for change
And so was I
She was a Jewish girl
I fell in love with her
She wrote her number on the back of my hand
I called her up
I was all out of breath
I said
""Come hear me play in my rock and roll band""
I took a shower
And I put on my best blue jeans
I picked her up in my new VW van
She wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath
I said ""Hi""
She said, ""Yeah, I guess I am""

Ariel
Ariel

We had a little time
We were real hungry
We went to Dairy Queen for something to eat
She had some onion rings
She had a pickle
She forgot to tell me how she didn't eat meat
I had a gig in the American Legion hall
It was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corps
She was sitting in a corner against the wall
She would smile
And I melted all over the floor

Ariel
Ariel

I took her home with me
We watched some TV
Annette Funicello and some guy going steady
I started fooling around with the verticle
We got the munchies
So I made some spaghetti

We sat and we talked into the night
While channel two was signing off the air
I found the softness of a mouth
We made love
The bombs bursting in air

Lost and all alone
I always thought that I could make it on my own
But since you left I hardly make it through the day
My tears get in the way
And I need you back to stay

I wander through the night
And search the world to find the words to make it right
All I want is just the way it used to be
With you here close to me
I've got to make you see

That I'm lost without your love
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of
And I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel
A touch without a feel
I can't believe it's real

But someday soon I'll wake
And find my heart won't have to break

Yes, I'm lost without your love
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of
All I want is just the way it used to be
I need you here with me

On a morning from a Bogart movie in a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre, contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations, she'll just tell you that she came

In the Year of the Cat

She doesn't give you time for questions as she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow till your sense of which direction completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls, there's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says: ""I feel my life!"" Just like a river running through

The Year of the Cat

Well, she looks at you so coolly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in Incense and Patchouli
So, you take her to find what's waiting inside

{Instrumental Bridge}

Well, morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So, you have to stay on
But, the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But, for now you're going to stay

Ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ah-ah

Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
I said nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun

Better make a move now (Well, well)
You know there ain't no time to lose now
Oh, well, his finger's on the trigger, he's waiting to deliver
Can we ever figure out a way to make the people shout?

Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun

Find a new direction (Well, well, well)
Another resurrection, yeah, yeah, yeah (Well, well, well)
Now don't wait, hesitate, or it's gonna be too late
(Flames are getting higher) Got to jump out of the fire

He's watching us burn, he's watching us burn
One day we'll learn, one day we'll learn
Fee-fi-fo-fum


Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun

Find a new direction (Well, well)
Another resurrection, yeah, yeah, yeah (Well, well, well)
Now don't wait, hesitate, or it's gonna be too late
(Flames are getting higher) Got to jump out of the fire

He's watching us burn, he's watching us burn
One day we will learn, one day we'll learn
Fee-fi-fo-fum

Fee-fi-fo-fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Fee-fi-fo-fum (His finger's on the trigger, he's waiting to deliver)
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
(Can we ever figure out a way to make the people shout?)
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Fee-fi-fo-fum (Now don't wait, hesitate, or it's gonna be too late)
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
(Flames are getting higher, got to jump out of the fire)
