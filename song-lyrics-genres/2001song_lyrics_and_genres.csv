Desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
I'm chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

Forgetting all I'm lacking
Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me now

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

There's nothing else to lose
There's nothing else to find
There's nothing in the world
That can change my mind
There is nothing else
There is nothing else
There is nothing else

Desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
I'm chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

Now, that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey-hey
Since the return of her stay on the Moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey-hey
Hey-hey, yeah

But tell me, did you sail across the Sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now, that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracin' her way through the constellation, hey-hey (Mmm)
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey-hey, yeah
Now, that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly, so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (The light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you sail across the Sun?

Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game
And the game don' chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy hoes, they're one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me, the only man that hovers above me, holla

I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity

Tired of being alone? Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone? Yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends Yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand my love?

The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair

The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it poppin', hop in', let's ride up in the Benz

But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me

Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screaming what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it

While he was schemin'
I was beamin' in the Beamer just steamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shopping spree, yeah
And on my way, I grabbed Soley and Mia
And as the cashbox rang, I thought everything away

(Oops!) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops!) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now

(Oops!) There goes ""You'll never leave me alone""
(Oops!) For all the lies you told
This is what you're owed

Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

(Get your hands on his cash and)

While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away

And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old

11,12,"""It Wasn't Me""",Shaggy featuring Rikrok,"1 ContributorIt Wasn’t Me (Shaggy’s Verses Translated) Lyrics
Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man...
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

How come you gave the women accеss to your villa?
Trespass and witnessing the hacklin’ of your pillow
You bеtter watch your back before she turn into a killer
You best review the situation that you’re caught up inna
To be a true player you must know how to play
If she say it was in the night, convince her that it’s the day
Never admit to a word that she says
And if she claims it’s you tell her “Baby, no way”

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

Let her know she really has no reason to be vexed
It’s never you she saw making the gigolo flex
It was someone that resembles you in the complex
Seein’ is believing so you better change your specs
You know she's going to bring up a lot of things up from the past
All the little evidence, you better know to mask
Quick on your answers, know how to talk
But if she packs a gun, you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wa-wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me","reggae, dancehall, Hip-Hop, pop, rnb"

And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile
Since I could call you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

And it's been awhile
Since I could say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile
Since I can say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again, again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

And it's been awhile
Since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute

See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind

You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled

But you remind me of a girl that I once knew (Oh, oh)

You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Won't believe, won't believe, won't believe it, baby, uh, oh no, no)

Thought that she was the one for me

This is why I just can't get with you (Uh)

See her face whenever I, I look at you (Gotta let you go)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Said I had, huh)

How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

Should be the one behind the wheel

With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there

Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See, I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Come my lady, come-come my lady

Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady

Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance

I got something to say, got something to say
Alright (Can you fill me in?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You were standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door""
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, whose property?
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)

All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
(Craig David)
Watchin' our every move
Think someday they might approve, baby

""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white

That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize
It's over, over
It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship
Gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart, but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right
I know it, know it

Don't make me promises
Baby, you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing

'Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
It's now or never

Is it all or nothing at all?

Sirens, limousines and the club owner, ya bitch, you
If you late, ain't no getting in this bitch 'cause it's filling up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough
I'm backstage bouncing, adrenaline building up
The pussy cutter, did I stutter?
The heart flutter, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Go down like Nelly, I'm hype like Belly
The rhyme seller, kick ass like Jim Kelly
Stand up, wild out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then, bitch, come on down
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit, then bitch, that's what it is

He was a six-foot stallion
Say, a storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder
How he put down the love
He had a hanky in his pocket
A phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpitatin'
Every time he came near (I do!!)
He got a spankin' new Range
For that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin'
He was plaided
And his hair was cornrowed
He had his wrists bling-blingin'
And his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me
But I knew he had me at go

Me and my crew started groovin'
Made our way to the floor
It's time to activate my plan
And give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip
And rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me
I felt fingertips (I do!!)
On the small of my back
So I had to react
Like I was playin' hard to get
And told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes
All I could see was his soul
I'm 'bout to make this guy my man
That I can tell you for sure

I do!!

Shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips
As I dip and roll
And watch me stop, stop traffic
As I walk through the room
Knowin' all the papis want me

Watch me drop, drop
Shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips

They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
How it could be now or might have been (Or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

I never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you, yeah

Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
And tomorrow can never be
'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
How it should be now or might have been (Or might have been)

Yes, you will, say you will, you know you will, oh, baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
Because love is a strange and funny thing (And funny thing)
No matter how I try and try (How I try), I just can't say goodbye
No, no, no, no

I've never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby

I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspense is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checkin' your clothes
And you wear the same size shoe
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are

There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So, I am convinced there's a stranger in my house

I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
Ain't leavin' no kisses, goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell
So, what could it be?
Is there someone imitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong when I say

There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So, I am convinced there's a stranger in my house

Pop quiz
Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me?
Have I changed so drastically?
Is it I want more for me
And you remained the same?

There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out (It took a while to figure out)
You can't be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me

You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you, for me
No corner you could squeeze me?
But I got all the time for you, love

The space between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter - keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild-eyed beast you be

The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

Will I hold you again?
Will I hold...
Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like
A devil in a church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The space between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room
The space between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain
Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Is all we need dear

What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you

Love
So many things I've got to tell you
But I'm afraid I don't know how
'Cause there's a possibility
That you'll look at me differently
Love
Ever since the first moment I spoke your name
From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change 'cause

Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

Many days I've longed for you
Wanting you
Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your touch, your feel, your Presence
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real
With no doubts and no fears
And no questions

So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

At first you didn't mean that much to me, no
But now I know you're all I need
The world looks so brand new to me
Now that I found love
Everyday I live for you, yeah
And everything that I do, I do it for you
What I say is how I feel so believe it's true
You got to know I'm true

Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts

For better or worse I still will choose you first

What is this, numbers in your pocket?
I remember when you used to throw those things away
Why do you wanna keep in touch now?
Who gave you a reason to act so shady?

Baby, you know, you can call me anytime
Anything you needed, I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you
Wanna act now, never call me back now
Turnin' off your cell phone, girl you know that ain't cool
I don't understand, baby

Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl, we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (It's over now)

You think that I don't know what's goin' on
'Cause you're always home alone
And I'm always out of town
You need to stop trying to play me
'Cause you can't even fade me
I know you're messin' around, baby

Baby, you know, you can call me anytime
Anything you needed, I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you
Wanna act now, never call me back now
Turnin' off your cell phone, girl you know that ain't cool
I don't understand, baby

Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
(Girl, we don't even kiss anymore, tell me why?)
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this

I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this (Like this)
But it's over now (It's over now)

Baby, it's a shame, shame that we go through
The things that we go through
When you're in love with me, and I'm in love with you
I think that we should talk, talk about our problems
Instead of running away
Oh baby, it's a shame, we couldn't work it out
Forgot what love was all about (The feelings we had from the start)
The feelings we had, my heart will always be with you
Girl, it's a shame

Baby, it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk, girl we don't even kiss
I never woulda thought we'd be breakin' up like this
But it's over now (It's over now)

It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say, ""Woe is me"" instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me, ""You're better off alone""

Morning will come
And the day will see

Well, it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion

The way you love with all you have

The way you move when you walk by

That never knocked me off my feet

Recorded in 2001, this album got a lot of success, about a million sales

This song is about a call from a man away from his family.
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say ""I love you"" one more time
And when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughin' in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
He said, ""Daddy, when you coming home?""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh, I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said, ""I really miss you, darling
Don't worry about the kids, they'll be alright""
Wish I was in your arms
Lyin' right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there 'til the end
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh, I'm already there

We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there 'til the end

She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up

Is what she got

If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you","country, modern country, Blake Shelton, male country, male vocalists"

Women on their cell making long john calls
And if they like to juggle, get long john's balls

And the ballin'-ass niggas with the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the floor, nigga, throw dem bows
All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties with a matching ass
With your fly-ass boots or your open-toes

Catfish fried up, Dirty South fed
Sleep in a cot'-picking Dirty South bed
Dirty South gurrls give me Dirty South head

Hand-me-down drug dealers hand me down rocks
Hand me down a 50-pack Swisher Sweets box
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks
Mouth full of platinum, mouth full of gold
40-Glock cal' keep your mouth on hold
Lie through your teeth, you could find your mouth cold
And rip out your tongue cause of what your mouth told
Sweat for the lemonade, sweat for the tea
Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D
And you can sweat from a burn in the 3rd degree
And if you sweat in your sleep, then you sweat from me

Drunk off the liquor getting hit by bars
Keep your girl close cause she's a hit, by far
Hit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars

Thugged-out blocks playing thugged-out games

I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I would been thinking my life is so hard
And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
""I haven't had my story yet""
And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
""I love you dad""

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

Here is a story about a man comin' in and
Finding his woman in bed with--
Well, listen

It's 2 A.M., I'm just getting in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her had she seen my baby
(Oh I) Drove my six around, looking for that missing lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused

And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa)
Hm, something's going on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah (Bump bump bump)
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screaming out

""You're contagious, touch me baby
Give me what you got"" (Then a man said)
""Sexy lady (Ooh) drive me crazy
Drive me wild"" (All I heard was my baby's voice screaming)
""You're contagious, touch me baby (Touch me)
Give me what you got"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
""Sexy lady (Then I heard another man) drive me crazy (Yeah)
Drive me wild"" (And I just can't believe this shit, aw yeah)

I ran downstairs, looked in the closet, looking for that, ooh
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplating, ""Not in my own damn house""
Who would have thought she was creeping with another man?
(Oh I) The down-low happening to me all over again

And then I turned the TV down (TV down, yeah)
'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound
Something going on up there upstairs
'Cause I know that no one else lives here (Bump bump bump)
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
Then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screamin'

""You're contagious (Whoa), touch me, baby (Oh)
Give me what you got"" (Then a man said)
""Sexy lady (Oh I) drive me crazy (Oh I)
Drive me wild"" (All I can do was hear them say)
""You're contagious, touch me baby (Ooh)
Give me what you got"" (Whoa)
""Sexy lady, drive me crazy
Drive me wild"" (Oh, I can't believe this shit, bump bump bump)

What the hell is going on between the sheets in my home?
Baby wait, let me explain before you start to point your cane
Girl, I'm 'bout to have a fit (Oh, it's about to be some shit)
How did I get in to this? Shoulda never came home with this bitch
You low down dirty woman, back to where you come from
(But baby, wait) ""But wait"" my ass, hit the streets, your ass is grass!
(Now Mr. Biggs, before you done) Wait, how you know my name son?
(Honey wait, I was gonna tell you) Move, this cat looks real familiar
Hmm, now don't I know you from somewhere a long time ago?
No, no, I don't think so
Yeah, yeah, I feel I know you brother very well
No, no, you're mistaking me for somebody else
(Frank!) Shut up! Can't you see two men are talking?
(But) Thought I told your ass to get to walking!
Now I think y'all better leave this place
'Cause I'm about to catch a case

I wish, I wish, I wish
(Every hood)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(And every block)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(Ghetto America!)

Rolling through the hood, just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know that your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed, going on four long years
I'm still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days you used to talk to me
Smiling while I'm sipping on this Hennessy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come, ut's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, ""Boy, you've been blessed""
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shooting this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass players get a real player hating 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And, boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of a tragic end
Damn, my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies land
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?

And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And, boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Instead of you all throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me

I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh


Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu-Manchu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good","country, travis tritt, male country, country rock, american"

It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light

And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do, baby, kiss me again

Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancing is as far as it goes
Girl, you've never moved me
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that

Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
You understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies
If you compare me to your local grocery, then
You'll see I got more karats than Aldi
More bread than aisle G, you can bag and scan me
Sure like Al B., meet the 'tics in Maui, hey

95,96,"""Be Like That""",3 Doors Down,"16 ContributorsBe Like That Lyrics
He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
""Why can’t that be me?""
'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
Now and dreams we run

She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs
Yeah

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
I’m falling into the same dreams
We run away

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush that I just did not want
Paid, was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, getting paid was everything

But I'm not every girl, and I don't need that world to validate me
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be giving you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream

But I'm not every girl, and I don't need no G to take care of me
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no, no

Most girls want a man with the bling bling (Most girls)
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling (Most girls)
Got my own thing, got the ching ching (Got my own)
I just want real love (I just want real love)
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

But I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G to take care of me, no
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart (Oh, most girls)

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love (I just want real love)
(Can you give me real love?)
Most girls want a man with the mean green (Most girls)
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching (Want my own)
I just want real love (Real love)
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
(I dream of)
A man that understands real love

'Cause I'm not most girls
Don't wanna dance if he can't be
Oh, everything
I, I just want real love, said I gotta have real love
Everything that, can you be everything that I dream of?","pop, pop rock, female vocalists, P!nk, rock"

Let me be your hero

Would you dance, if I asked you to dance?
Would you run, and never look back?
Would you cry, if you saw me crying?
Would you save my soul, tonight?
Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
Would you laugh? Oh please, tell me this
Now would you die, for the one you love?
Hold me in your arms, tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Would you swear, that you'll always be mine
Or would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away


Oh, I just wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you
Oh, yeah
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
Well, I don't care
You're here tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain (Oh yeah)
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

I can be your hero
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away

Memories are just where you leave them
Drag the waters, 'til the depths give up their dead
What did you expect to find?
Was it something you left behind?
Don't you remember anything I said when I said

Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

""Oh, hold me now, I feel contagious""
""Am I the only place that you've left to go?""
She cries her life is like
Some movie, black and white
Dead actors faking lines
Over and over and over again she cries

Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

And I wanted you to turn away
You don't remember, but I do
You never even tried

Don't fall away, and leave me to myself
Don't fall away, and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
