Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ohh)
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ohh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)
I guess that I don't need that, though (Ohh)

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't lookin' for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're goin', baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothin' at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight, and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're goin', baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that, I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're tryin' to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm tryin' hard to take it back

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like fallin' down
I'll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back, so let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be...
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If ""Happy Ever Afters"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Losing it all on my own

Touch my own skin

In an unlocked place

Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you

Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried

Some nights, I stay up cashin' in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?

I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's all right (That's all right)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who I, who I
Am, oh, who am I? Mm-mm
Mm-mm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again

Washed my hands of that for this?

The dream I just had about you and me
I'd called you up, but we both agreed

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again

Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you ""no,"" but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop,"" but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now, here you are again
So, let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh, but that one night
Is still the highlight

Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o

Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO

Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One time, fuck one time
I'm callin' niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy, so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall, put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, doorknob
Talk stupid, off with your head

Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say

Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else

Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

You know what? It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face, lookin' on the case
Tryna find a hella taste, oh, my God
I'm on the chase, Chevy, It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, ""Khalifa put the weed in a J""

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Uh, now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun
So we just roll one, smoke one

Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun

White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
""I'm on Fire"" and ""Born to Run""
You looked at me, and I was done
But we were just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang, ""Oh""
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin', ""Don't go""

When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear ""Born in the USA""
Do you relive those glory days
So long ago?

When you think about me, do you think about 17?
Do you think about my old Jeep?
Think about the stars in the sky?

I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”

Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more

Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am

Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

We share somethin' so common, but still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbin', even here inside these walls
Breakin' each others hearts and we don't care 'cause we're so

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around

Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile

And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile

Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile

Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand

For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals

But I really hate how you're easy to crack

Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky

Admiring at how sharply my first name is written

It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (Ugh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (Ugh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (Ugh)
And I was hoping you would— (Ayy)

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it, 'cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
The Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause you be sending me texts-es
Like, ""Boy, just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time, she—
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

You said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)

And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head, like
""What is he doing?"" (Oh) ""What is he doing?""
'Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
And you texting me, like, ""I'ma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh (Ooh)
Well, my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me tripping, and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (Worry 'bout nothing)
Girl, I got you (I got you), girl I got you
She might come and find me-ee (Nah-nah-nah)
And then ask me kindly-y (Oh, no, no)

Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the T-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home, waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib—
(It’s 5 o' clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night, and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less 'cause I’m sure you’re the best, you’re the one
So I let you—that's how you show me love
And when we finished, you like, “Damn, babe, you woke me up” (Whoa, oh)
I like you way you put it down, like it's for both of us (Oh, oh)

Heart beats fast, colors and promises
How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along, I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more


One step closer
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along, I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more","pop, female vocalists, singer-songwriter, indie, rock"

Been going 'round and 'round all day
Bailing some hay and stackin' it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the Quick Stop
Grab a couple rocky tops
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock

Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Man, I swear there ain't nothin' looks better than that
Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby, that's a good night
Anyone from the heartland is gonna understand
What I am talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Man, I swear there ain't nothin' looks better than that
Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do
I wanna take a little ride with you


Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, you can play my radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Man, I swear there ain't nothin' looks better than that

Like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
And get out of town

Got the stars comin' out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been

Ain’t no good for me

Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and Molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shine bright like a diamond
Oh, yeah

I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink too much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Good

You love me good","country, singer-songwriter, Lee Brice, modern country, male vocalists"

There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A ""No trespass"" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)

Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride","country, modern country, Jason Aldean, male vocalists, male country"

Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'

The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
