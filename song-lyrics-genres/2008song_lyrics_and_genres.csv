Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweatpants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)

Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

Hey, I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, woah
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them

Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I invented rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky, oh, me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her

Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)

Woah, shawty
Yeah, she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash and I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back, got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack, I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin', and them Rosé bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock

Hey

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Mm, yeah

Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open, mmh

And it's drainin' all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
Ooh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love (You)

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Will you count me in?

I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under covers, stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mm

Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now

You tuck me in, just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows

I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still

Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now, I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Mm, mm

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be
Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to come on
Scootch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ha
Mhm

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)
'Cause our time is short (This is our fate)
This, oh, this, oh, this is our fate

Oh, oh, oh

No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I get what I'm askin' for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free
To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind

Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you (I'll always have you)
(I'll always have you)

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror
It didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong, and then change my mind

Sorry, but I gotta be strong and leave you behind

Won't change any moment
There's still a part of me in you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do, oh-oh

Ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)

So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)

Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy

My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy

My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

¿Quien es la tendencia en el mundo ahora mismo? (Uh)
Acabo de aterrizar en la ciudad de Londres (Uh)
Apuesto a que me dan una libra (Uh)
Diles que pongan el dinero en mi mano ahora mismo (Si)

Realmente quiero venir a hacerlo contigo
Serás mi chico Americano

Acabo de conocer a este chico de 5 pies a 7 que es justo mi tipo
Como la forma en que está hablando, su confianza está llegando a su punto máximo
No me gustan sus jeans holgados, pero podría gustarme lo que hay debajo de ellos
Y, no, no he andando con MIA
Escuché que California nunca llueve y Nueva York está bien despierta
Primero veamos el West End, te mostraré a mi bredin
Me gusta este chico Americano, chico Americano

Vamos de compras, tal vez luego vayamos a un café
Vamonos en el metro, llévame a tu barrio
Nunca he estado en Brooklyn y me gustaría ver lo que es bueno
Vestido con toda tu ropa elegante
Las zapatillas se ven frescas hasta la muerte, me encantan esos Shell Toes
Caminando esa caminata, habla esa astuta charla
Me gusta este chico Americano, chico Americano

Llévame de viaje, me gustaría ir algún día
Llévame a Nueva York, me encantaría ver LA

Serás mi chico Americano

De mala gana, porque la mayoría de esta prensa no me jode

No actúes como un tonto ahora, ahora""
Siempre actuo como un tonto, oww, oww
Ni hay nada nuevo ahora, ahora
Él está loco, se lo que estás pensando
Ribena, se lo que estás bebiendo

¿Soy superficial porque toda mi ropa es diseñada? Uh

Pero sigo hablando de di-i-inero

Y me siento como Mike en su peor momento
Como The Pips en su mejor momento

He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed

Oh, I had a lot to say
Was thinking on my time away
I missed you and things weren't the same

'Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry, it makes me wanna die

I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know, I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby, the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry

This time, I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame

'Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry, it makes me wanna die

I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
It's never too late to make it right

That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose

And he tells her there will be a new chapter

And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback

Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Yeoaw!)

Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gon' rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (Rock!)
And Pamela (Rock!) and Samantha (Rock!)
And Amanda and Tamara, ménage à moi
I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What the saints forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock
Just let it rock (Rock!), let it rock (Rock!), let it rock

Let it rock

I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'

Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach

Either with her girlfriends or showstoppin' with her hustler
The way she move her body, she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy, always tight and never sloppy
And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go again, ridin' through the stormy weather
You better button up, if you wanna go get her
Cause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover

Voy a estar en esta televisión mamá, voy
Voy a poner mierdas

Bienvenido a la buena vida, donde los negros que venden D
Ni siquiera será detenido en su nueva V
La buena vida, vamos a vivir una juerga
Mierda, dicen que las mejores cosas de la vida son gratis
La buena vida, se siente como en Atlanta
Se siente como en Los Ángeles, se siente como en Miami
Se siente como en MI, Chicago de verano
¡Ah! (Ahora lanza tus manos al cielo)
Así que la paso bien
Ustedes abren el maletero, yo abro al barrio, Ferrari
Y ella consiguió los bienes
Y ella tiene ese trasero, tengo que mirarlo, ¡lo siento!

Yo, tiene que ser porque estoy experimentado
Los que me odian me miran salados, Lawry

Y si lo odian, déjalos odiar y mira cómo se acumula el dinero""

Porque tienen más (Culo que los modelos)
La buena vida, así que sigue viniendo con las botellas
Porque ella se siente borracha como si hubiera bombardeada en Apollo
La buena vida, se siente como en Houston
Se siente como en Filadelfia, se siente como en D.C
Se siente como en VA o en la Bahía o en Yay
Ayy, esta es la buena vida (Bienvenido a la buena vida)
Hermano, dime que es bueno
Por qué solo tengo un problema cuando estás en el barrio (Bienvenido a la buena vida)
Como si fuera nuevo en el barrio
Lo único que desearía; desearía que un negro lo hiciera (¡Bienvenido a la buena vida!)
Probablemente piense que podría
Pero, pero, no creo que deba (Bienvenido a la buena vida)

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
""Sweet Home Alabama,"" oh, yeah
Turn it up!

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man, I'd love to see that girl again
(Man, I'd love to see that girl again) Yeah

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

You stand by while he lies, then turn right round and forgive

But what can I do? I gotta stay true 'cause deep down, I'm still a G

And I don't wanna come between you and your man
Even though I know I'd treat you better than he can

Girl, I can't help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don't change
Can't help but wait 'til you see that with me, it ain't the same
Can't help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are

It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You're a queen, you should be getting all that someone's got
You should be rocking the latest in purses, bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than an occasional ""I love you, I'm thinking of you""

So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time and you know is gonna be there
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down, who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Gives me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Out the many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that has cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones without reading innuendos
And they found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifters fun has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Gives me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

I wanna tell you what you do to thank you
Practice what you preach
And now I know there's nothing we can't reach
'Cause a heart can't erase once it's found a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held and sheltered

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right

Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot)
Fuck you, nigga
And I'm grindin' 'til I'm tired 'cause they said
""You ain't grindin' until you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find, a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you don' took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right?
My life

Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces? (My life)
‘Cause that's Jesus' people
And Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel, yeah
Like Roc-A-Fella needed Sigel, like I needed my father
But he needed a needle (My life)
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why
Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile (My life)
Damn, I know his mama proud, and since you helped me sell my dream
We can share my mama now
And like M.J.B., no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mind state, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty, like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

And I'm grindin' 'til I'm tired ‘cause they said

Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts

I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good, it never made her happy
But I bet that new Mercedes could (My life)
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should (My life)
With the top back
In my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I still keep this motherfucker cocked back

Didn't know where I would go, where I would be

But somehow, deep inside, still lovin' you

Y el clima es tan ventoso

Y traté de follarte con el ol-wu-wopte

92,93,"""You're Gonna Miss This""",Trace Adkins,"16 ContributorsYou’re Gonna Miss This Lyrics
She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down

Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23
Heh... It's hard to believe, but

But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this
Yeah, you're gonna miss this","country, trace adkins, modern country, male country, male vocalists"

A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like a lunar landing
Make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
Everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

Find the place where we escape
Take you with me for the space
The city buzz, it sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur, they're all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
So all have stayed in place
We should've had the sun
Could've been inside
'Stead, we're over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time, too long defending
You and I have done pretending

I never thought that I had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change

I, oh, I, I wish this could last forever
I, oh, I, as if we could last forever
Love remains the same
Love remains the same","alternative rock, rock, alternative, singer-songwriter, british"

You, you got me
Thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me
""Come and take a look inside""
You believe me
In every single lie
But I, I failed you this time

And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right

And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

I never felt like this before
Just when I leave, I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever-changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes
No room left to move in-between you I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang

Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night

Sent from heaven

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been
You may have got your heart broken a few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Ooh, no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away (When love)
And you can't help who you love (Just can't help who you love)
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Sent from heaven)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven) (Ooh, 'cause)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven)

Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What the fear from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Loving what you thought that could've been
Notice when you change
When you don't feel as good as you used to before
And everything you used to say
Everything you used to do clear right out the door

Ooh, no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you walk away
And you can't help who it loves
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, 'cause I wanna be, hey, yeah

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Oh, sent from above, yeah)
