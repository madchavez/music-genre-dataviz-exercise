0,1,"""Look Away""",Chicago,"11 ContributorsLook Away Lyrics
When you called me up this morning, told me 'bout the new love you found
I said, ""I'm happy for you, I'm really happy for you""
Found someone else, I guess I won't be coming 'round
I guess it's over, baby, it's really over, baby, woah
And from what you said, I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's gotta be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay

But if you see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
And if we meet on the streets someday and I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

When we both agreed as lovers we were better off as friends
That's how it had to be, yeah, that's how it had to be
I tell you I'm fine, but sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me, wish you were still holding me, woah
I just never thought that I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be

But if you see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
And if we meet on the streets someday and I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way


If you see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
And if we meet on the streets someday and I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me

You see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

When you called me up this morning, told me about the new love you found
I said, ""I'm happy for you, I'm really happy for you""","classic rock, rock, 70s, 80s, pop"

Get busy!

Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me (Now now)
Why don't they just let me live? (Ooh)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative

They say I'm crazy, I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn
Gettin' girls is how I live
Some ask me questions, why am I so real?
But they don't understand me
Or really don't know the deal about a brother

Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped

Without all of the things that people say?

Yo, Teddy, kick it like this
Oh, no, no

We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn, yeah, it does

I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say, ""Love's a game of easy come
And easy go""
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow, I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn","hard rock, hair metal, 80s, rock, classic rock"

Oh, oh, oh, oh

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle

And it's lookin' pretty worn

You wrapped me round your little bitty finger

You kept me hangin' on a lover's cross awhile
You put your spell on me, took my breath away

I'm not that kind of guy who can take a broken heart
So don't ever leave, I don't want to see us part
The very thought of losing you means
That everything would go down under

I'll be loving you forever

(I'll be loving you) Loving you
Yeah

I count the blessings that keep our love new
There's one for me and a million for you
There's just so much that I wanna say
But when I look at you, all my thoughts get in the way

I'll be loving you forever

Give me time to care
The moment's here for us to share
Still my heart
Is not always there
What more can I say to you?
Could I lie to you?
I'm just too weak to face the truth
Now I know
I should make a move
What more can I say?

How can I fall?
How can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't
Give me reasons at all

When all faith is gone
I fight myself to carry on
Yet, I know of the harm I do
What more can I say to you?

Now I hold this line
I know the choice to leave is mine
I can't help
What I feel inside
What more can I say?


I'll follow through
I'll see I do
When the time is far more
Right for you
I'll make that move
And when I do
Will I doubt again the way I do?

How can I fall?
How can I fall?
(How can I fall?)
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

How can I fall?
How can I fall?
(How can I fall?)
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons

Just won't give me reasons
Just won't give me reasons at all

It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way

30,31,"""The Living Years""",Mike + The Mechanics,"23 ContributorsThe Living Years Lyrics
Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts
So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be okay

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)

Let's do it

Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride, went to a club, was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king?""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing""

Wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night?""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect, hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame, I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when bodies start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please


Wild thing

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She wanted to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, ""Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing""

Say what?
Yo love, you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here

Wearing padded bras, sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours? (Gigolo)

Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay
But we got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothin' when I'm by your side
We got somethin' that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum (All night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (And it's alright)
And I'll never let go 'cause there's somethin' I know deep inside

You were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet He must've had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby, that's okay
Our time, our way
So hold me close, better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
Two kids hitchin' down the road of life
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (All night)
There's a chance we'll get by (And it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll live in my heart 'til the day that I die

'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

Talk about the love you're missing
Maybe then it's true when they say love is blind
I can help you if you listen
I can make you feel good if you just let me try

If everlasting love is what you're waiting for
Then that time for you, it just has arrived
So here I am, come walk right through my door

But I gotta know that you're there to receive
I can be your only woman
But I gotta feel that I'm all that you need

I'll be your everything and I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you lonely at night
So here I am, come walk right through my door

Bust it

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya overzealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous
Okay smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by, you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking, guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance 'cause she likes to groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move

Ah, ha, yeah, ha
Ah, ha, yeah, ha (Just bust a move)
Aha, yeah, aha, yeah
Ah, ha, yeah, ha, ha

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Couldn't care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says, ""Hello
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move

You want it, you got it
You want it, baby, you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby, you got it

In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

You want it, you got it, uh
You want it, baby, you got it (Just bust a move), ah
You want it, uh, you got it, ah

In five days from now, he's gonna marry

And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin', then you start blinking
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks you're kinda cute, so she winks back
And now you're feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wanna dance to a different groove

Well, the times are getting hard for you, little girl
I'm a-humming and a-strumming all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Now, it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work, and it's oh, so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half-way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye, she was giving what she got

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Woman, you're a mess, going to die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messing around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So, you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

I didn't know you had a rock and roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark as it's dumb

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

I don't want you to come 'round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
'Cause when you say it's over with him
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
But one look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me
Still I want to hold you, touch you
When you look at me that way
There's only one solution, I know it
You gotta stay away from me
Stay away from me

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control

And suddenly my heart can't tell you no

You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me

'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold

You know they never last, no no

To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test

But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

I don't mind if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care cause you've got something I can share
Hey, take a chance, even if it's only
Only while we're dancing in the
Light of your second sight because
When you understand me
You might feel good around me now

I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around

I won't turn you out if you've got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realise
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination

I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
I don't want your love, I don't want your love
Your rhythm is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love


I like noise cause, I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down. I can't shut my mouth
But when you understand me
You might feel good around me

I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
Your rhythm is the power to move me

And everything is turnin' gray
All I made was one mistake

Alright, dig it

Cold coolin' at a bar
And I'm lookin for some action
But like Mick Jagger said
I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around
But none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def
Yo, what's up with L-O-C?
The girls is all jockin'
At the other end of the bar
Havin drinks with some no-name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over
To the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?""
He said, ""Funky Cold Medina""
Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret
On how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass
And the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol
Or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion
And she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog
When he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me
Before he was much, much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house
For the Funky Cold Medina
You know what I'm sayin'?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door
I got Spuds MacKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

I went up to this girl
She said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go
With a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink,""
I said, ""Ehm, I'll go get it""
And then a couple sips she cold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib
And everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess
Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around
With no Oscar Mayer wiener
You must be sure that your girl is pure
For the Funky Cold Medina
You know?
Ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80s, and you know I'm down with the ladies
No joke

Break it down

Back in the saddle
Lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on
""The Love Connection""
The audience voted
And you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton
For Medina and some dinner
We had a few drinks
I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' 'bout
Plans for our wedding
Said ""Wait. Slow down love, not so fast
Baby, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't fool around
With the Funky Cold Medina
You know what I'm sayin'?
That Medina's a monster

My heart is filled with so much love
And I need someone I can call my own
To fall in love, that's what everyone's dreaming of
I hold this feeling, oh, so strong

Life is too short to live alone
Without someone to call my own
I will care for you, you will care for me
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for

I close my eyes and pray all my wishes come true
Every night I go to sleep
Until you're mine, I'll wait for you endlessly
Can't you see

Fairy tales, they do sometimes come true
If you believe, it could happen to you
Like the stars that shine way up in the sky
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for

Baby, I get so scared inside and I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind or is it fantasy?
Heaven is in the palm of my hand and it's waitin' here for you

Will it all remain the same?

So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me
Like a dagger, you stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave?

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?
No, I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?
No, I'll never feel the same

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

O' beautiful, for spacious skies
Now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And tall grass waves in the wind

Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Oh, who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby, give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye

Just lay your head back on the ground

Don't stop like the hands of time
Click, clock, find your own way to stay
The time will come one day
Why do people choose to live their lives this way?

Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving

It's our time, time today
The right time is here to stay
Stay in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will surely come
When you'll be in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays

(Keep on moving)
Keep on moving (Don't stop)
Keep on moving, don't stop, no (Like the hands of time)
Keep on moving (Click, clock)
(Find your own way to stay)
Keep on moving
The time will come one day (Time will come one day, oh, oh)
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving (Hey)
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving

I know the time, time today
Walking alone in my own way
Extremely cold and rainy day
Friends and I have fun along the way
Yes, we do
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will really come
When you'll be in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays

(Keep on moving)
Keep on moving (Don't stop)
Keep on moving, don't stop, no (Like the hands of time)
Keep on moving (Click, clock)
Keep on moving (Find your own way to stay)
The time will come one day (Yes, oh)
Keep on moving
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving (Hey)
Keep on moving
The time will come one day (Hey)
Keep on moving (Moving, don't stop, no)
Don't stop like the hands of time (Hey)
Click, clock, find your own way to stay
The time will come one day
Why do people choose to live their lives this way? (Oh, oh, why do they choose to live this way?)
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving (Keep on moving in my own way, I know the time will come today)
The time will come one day
Keep on moving
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
The time will come one day
Keep on moving
Keep on moving, don't stop, no
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
The time will come one day (I know the time, I know the time)
