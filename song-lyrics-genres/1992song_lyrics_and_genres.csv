Girl, you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playin' with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try, I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

Will you love me again like you loved me before?
This time, I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me, don't let me down, oh

Although we've come to the end of the road (End of the road)
Still, I can't let go (The end of the road and I know I can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still, I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat all night (Maybe I'll forgive you, baby)
Just like you did, baby, but that's alright
Heh, I love you anyway (Maybe you'll try)
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day, baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (We should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)
Will you? Just come back to me (Yeah, yeah)

(Lonely) Yes, baby, my heart is lonely
(Lonely) My heart hurts, baby
(Lonely) Yes, I feel pain too
(Lonely) Baby, please

This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road (We've come to the end of the road)
Still, I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still, I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural (Baby), you belong to me (Baby), I belong to you (Baby)
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go (Alright, alright, alright)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you, woah)
Come to the end of the road (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still, I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no)

Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, it is so big, ugh
She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends, but, ugh, you know
Who understands those rap guys? Ugh, they only talk to her
Because she looks like a total prostitute, okay?
I mean, her butt, it's just so big
Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean, ugh, gross, look, ugh, she's just so black
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get with ya
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (Me-me so horny)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me 'cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin', to hell with romancin'
She sweat, wet, got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (Yeah), Fellas (Yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it)
Shake that healthy butt, baby got back

(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh-ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sisters, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna— (Uh)
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (Yeah), Ladies (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout

Baby got back
Baby got back

Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection
36-24-36? Haha, only if she's 5'3""

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game, but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

How high? Real high 'cause I'm just so fly

And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside out, it's wiggida wiggida wiggida wack

To the back you'll be sportin' the gear; is that coincidental?
Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental
Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And nuthin' fake and you can understand every word (Word, hahaha)

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing
You're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Mornings alone
When you come home
I breathe a little faster
Every time we're together
It'd never be the same
(It’d never be the same)
If you're not here
How can you stay away, away so long?
Why can't we stay together?
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
    
'Cause I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
It's just another day

Making the time
Find the right lines
To make you stay forever
What do I have to tell you?
I'm just trying to hold on to something
(Trying to hold on to something good)
Give us a chance to make it
No, no, no
Don't wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong
I'm not that strong

I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you, no

Why can't you stay forever
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason

I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you

Baby no

You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips

And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart

You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you, but I don't want to be the one to cry
And that don't really matter to anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door
(Chorus)
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Now, I could never change you, I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you, but I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all
It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change
(Chorus)
And there's no way home, when it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you, where I used to lay?
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes, love... it just ain't enough

I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right?
Don't you know you were my life?

Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am, still holding on
I can't accept my world is gone (No, no)

Even though I try, I can't let go
'Cause something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside
Every day of my life?
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies?
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still, you remain on my mind

Even though I try, I can't let go
(No, I just can't get you out of my mind)
Something in your eyes captured my soul
(I never can say goodbye)
'Cause every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let you go

That old dog has chained you up all right
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Ohhhh
Ohhhh

This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
I give you something sweet each time you
Come inside my jungle book
What is it just too good
Don't say you'll stay
'Cause then you go away

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm

Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed

You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn I wish I was your lover

If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever

I sat on the mountainside with peace of mind
I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear
Walked for days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed

Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

But still, I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah

I know life can be so tough and you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers if you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do

Still, I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen (Oh no)
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night and pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen (He's gonna make it happen)
If you believe in yourself enough (If you believe)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen (Yes, you are)
Make it happen (Make it happen)
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord (You just gotta hold on)
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen

Make it happen, oh-oh, yeah, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen (Yes, he is)
If you believe in yourself enough (If you believe)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen (You can make it)
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen, yeah
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it (You're gonna make it)

I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one

Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans the cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing
I think it's one of those déjà vu things
Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it
I don't know, I doubt it
Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs. Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone; solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, ""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me""
She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

A careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring
An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
'Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
But guess whose piece of the cake was jacked on?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do
And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me

If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go out alone
Don't think I'll understand

Stay with me

In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in-betweens
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more

(Stay) Stay with me
Stay with me

You'd better hope and pray
That you make it safe back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you wake one day in your own world
'Cause when you sleep at night
They don't hear your cries in your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell back in your own world

Nothing's so loud
As hearing when we lie

And you've said neither am I

And the air outside, so soft

As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave, I know

And the air outside, so soft
Confessing everything

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, feel the same
All I want is to feel this way

And it won't matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be

My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then, the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes

First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
Saw the man inside

We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I, surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

I think about my life gone by
How it's done me wrong

Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes a woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear 
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me

I am everyday people, yeah
See I am everyday people, yeah
I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

I am everyday people, yeah

Well, the key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night
I couldn't stand to hear the crying of my mother
And I remember when I swore that
That would be the last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes, he said
""You're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine""
Oh, his words how they hurt me
I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by
I lived to regret it
""You're no son, you're no son of mine"" (No son of mine)
But where should I go and what should I do
""You're no son, you're no son of mine"" (No son of mine)
But I came here for help, I came here for you

Well the years they passed so slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away
In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang that bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes, he said:

Huh yeah let me introduce y'all to the wildside
Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas singing nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it in all in stride
Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations
Besides that she had expectations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside
(Chorus)
Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside

(Chorus)
Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill Carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!

(Chorus)
Little Tiffany. Only thirteen
Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
Out of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died

Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me please, darling, rescue me

Every cross that we bear

When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
Then and only then will I be satisfied

But it feels like forever and it's hard to be strong

And it's drivin' me crazy

V-Town, brother check it out, I'm bout to throw down
Dank in hand, the shit that has you toe down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boys don't play, fool
Yorker sidin', you know how the song goes
In the back, sippin' Purple Chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us
Forty grippin', panty sippin', and it sneaks up right behind us
Quick left, one blow K.O
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh what the hell, I guess I better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kit on
A fifth of Heem, for me to get bent on
Hit the Country Club to pick up M-L
Eighty West, back to the hotel

At the telly, Vogues is doing pipe work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The latte in the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, rolling striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 turnin' triple gold Zeens
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
'Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Laying in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the telly, I gotta get some 'Nuca'
Nuca (echoes)

Aw naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her so I called TL
Swoop me up, Sally wanna meet Dick
And might lick, so try an' make it real quick

Aw yeah, I jumped in the L-Train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store mayne
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tacs
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjacks
We got the goods, now we're headin' for the hoedown
There goes the telly, so fella won't you slow down
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case, we gotta bust a quick one
Lock the load, let's go look for like 118
But lay low cause I really don't wanna be seen
(Is this the room?) Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the light man, I just might man

We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I'll find
A real love

So I've tried my best and prayed to God he'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

90,91,"""That's What Love Is For""",Amy Grant,"7 ContributorsThat’s What Love Is For Lyrics
Sometimes we make it harder than it is
We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way

Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

Sometimes I see you
And you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away
By emotions I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire
And holding on we find

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

Believing in the one thing
That has gotten us this far

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Round off the edges
Talk us down from the ledges
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for
That's what love is for
That's what love is for
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

That's what love is for
That's what love is for
That's what love is for","pop, christian, female vocalists, contemporary christian, gospel"

I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothing, in fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day but daddy don't agree
Because when I try to get away, he says, he got plans for me
""Get your butt right out of bed""
Stop bugging me
""Get up and move your sleepy head""
Don't shake my tree
He said, ""Mow the lawn"", who me?
""Walk the dog"", not my style, man
""Take out the trash"", no way
""Tidy your room"", come on, get real
Sorry Dad, got to disappear
Let's get the rock out of here

In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long

What she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

In at the deep end, hang on tight

Every time I want to love you, I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancing with this broom
I feel lucky today
