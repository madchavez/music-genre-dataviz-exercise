All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know?
If they move too quick (Oh-way-oh)
They're falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (Oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around, and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (Oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (Oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

Walk like an Egyptian


Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard, you know (Oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac
If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (Oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (Oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh, way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)

I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

'Til now, I always got by on my own

Head to toe
I know

Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known?

Who would have thought that we would become lovers?
As friends we were so, so tight
Can't help myself, you make me feel so right
I got to, got to tell you, darling

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you from head to toe

Here today, gone tomorrow
It's possible, but I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it
He's different from any boy I know
Body supreme
Bedroom eyes, head back to the side
Please don't be so mean

Fourteen karat love, you are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love, diamonds are forever
Top to bottom, I love you
I will leave you never

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away

Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight

I should've walked away, I should've walked away

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment has gone

Something in the moonlight catches my eye
The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow, so
Give me love, give me heart and soul
You never let me cross to the other side now
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Hard on the heels of something more
But I lost your love, heart and soul
The tear in my heart as you walk on by (More than an ocean)
I feel so low and your head is high
Everything you do convinces me more (Keeps us apart)
Please give me love, give me heart and soul
Looking to the day when I saw your face (I feel a tearing)
I wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race (In half of my heart)
You move in a way that I've known before
Now I want your love, heart and soul

Leaving you ain't easy now (Tired eyes, tears that dried)
Loving you's the harder part (On the bed, on the pillow, where the love has died)
You never want me for myself (A turn of the key, through the door you go)
Now I've needed you right from the very start (Don't look back, to hurt me more )

A little bit of heart and soul

Walking on the water, walking on the air (A walk on the water)
That was the heart of the love we shared
Do you keep secret left untold? (Is all that I need?)
Can't give love, heart or soul
I used to have a lover with a Midas touch (But miracles are not happening)
I turned to gold but he turned to dust
Left me for another, I turned to stone
Now give me love, heart and soul

Living in a fantasy (Tired eyes, tears that dried)
There's never any room to breathe (On the bed, on the pillow, where you told your lies)
Hoping every waking hour (A turn of the key, my blood runs cold)
You'll turn around and say that we can start (Don't look back to hurt me more)

Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all

No, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you I let go
Oh, you can surely see
You're so much more to me
Just one look and I knew

You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find

Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

All that time I was searching with nowhere to run to
It started me thinking
Wondering what I have could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice
And no one listening

All this time
I still remember everything you said, ah-ha
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
Ooh, you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh, I know you're going, but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all
It may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons, being alone

Listen

Pay attention — are you listening?
You're my favorite girl
Excuse me for the moment
I'm in another world
On a mountain, by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with cupid
The picture's very clear

Hang the sign upon the door
I say, ""Don't disturb this groove""
(All I want is just me and you)
Just a way to say that
(That's simple enough)
I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real, don't disturb this groove

Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for the moment
I'm at a loss for words
By election, sheer perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place
So don't you go and change
Baby, over and over
The passion starts again (Again)
You're my lollipops and everything
With a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from Heaven
And the day the earth stands still

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

When I come home you telephone
To say you're waiting for me
I ask you why - I hear you cry
But you're still waiting for me

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
To cry over me
Someday I'll be losing this fear

Now I'm alone, you telephone
To tell me you don't need me
I ask you why, you tell me lies
And say the truth would hurt me

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
To cry over me
Someday I'll be losing this fear
Oh, Oh ... someday


Down in the street where lovers meet
That's where I'm waiting for you
In the streets where lovers meet
I'm still waiting for you

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
And then you'll cry over me (cry over me)

And then you'll cry over me (cry over me)

Debonair lullabies
In melodies revealed
In deep despair on lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings, he sings

Elegance in eloquence
For sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes and match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies that soothe the rage
When lovers' hearts catch fire

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
Smashing the hell
With the heaven she brings
Then Smokey sings, he sings

(Would it be true to say)
Luther croons
Sly's the original originator
James screams
Marvin was the only innovator
But nothing can compare
Nothing can compare
When Smokey sings

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
She threw back the ring
When Smokey sings

I've heard talk of blind devotion
Lovers through thick and thin
Lives touched with real emotion
Faithful till the bitter end
Now I must admit that the story's attractive
I've lost in far too many affairs
I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring
I need to prove to myself

Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night?
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love?

So many nights in blind confusion
I've walked the line of love
We reach out in disillusion
When one night isn't nearly enough
Now I'd like to know that for once in my life
I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring
I've heard all your talk
Can I take it to heart
Now look me straight in the eye
'Cause tonight is the night
We've got to ask each other
If the moment is right

Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night?
Is this love that I'm feelin'?

Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands
All touch, no feeling
Just another one night stand

Could you be the angel to answer my prayers?

Love can make you weep
Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap
This thing
Is happening to us all

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I hold you in my arms
As the band plays
What are those words whispered, baby
Just as you turn away?
I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind to know
Just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow
Well, I've tried so hard, baby
But I just can't see
What a woman like you
Is doing with me

So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
Oh, when out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I wanna know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand
Oh, we stood at the altar
The gypsy swore that our future was right
But come the wee, wee hours
Well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
