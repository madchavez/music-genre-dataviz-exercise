Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah


I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me","soul, singer-songwriter, pop, rnb, Neo-Soul"

My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget (Oh, Lord), I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend, oh, Lord

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (We go way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late, but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord (Tell 'em drinks on me)

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street (Come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take

Oh, ooh
Please don't take

I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?

Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'

How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy

Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer

It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

Зажгу косяк в этой суке
Метро, Метро, Метро, три раза
Йеа

Следуем кодексу, все эти шлюхи созданы для улиц
Засунул ей в нос, теперь её киска потечёт
Ссыкуны стуканули, не увидят света дня
Может, щелчка и не слышно, но слышно, как эти челы вопят
Все мои шлюшки под грибами, бля, все мои шлюшки под коксом
Кольцо двадцать карат, засунул пальцы ей глубоко в рот (А, а, а)
Если карат пропадёт, она удавится (А, а, а)
Я знаю, она сглотнёт, она в этом G.O.A.T. (А, а, а)
Freeband, на хуй, тащи бабки сюда
Мои стрелки в углу, стоят стаей
Она думает, что она экзотическая сучка и поэтому красива
Из-за такого дерьма тебя вынесут на районе, брр
И девиз у нас всё тот же
Шикую, будто выиграл игру за чемпионство
Ты знаешь, как эти шлюхи голодны, они трахнутся за статус
Подтянул её в банду, она трахнулась за цепь
Твоя девка в этой суке, она вертится на члене
У меня сироп в этой суке, тусим в этой суке
Мы принесли Перки в эту суку, наебашимсь в этой суке
Вся эта ювелирка на мне, детка, ну что ж, время поиграть
Зови подружку, сучка, мы трахнем их одновременно
Я на другом уровне, нет, мы не одной породы
Можешь взять ту малую, если её ещё не взял я (Йеа)

Юный дилер, торгуешь дурью, реально ты таков? (Если ты таков)
Выбиваешь двери, вламываешься в двери, реально ты таков? (Йеа)
Юный пацан на кайфе, торгуешь дешёвкой, реально ты таков? (Йеа)
Весь 24-ый ты на ходу, реально ты таков? (Если ты таков)

Шагай в Баленсиаге, если ты таков (Если ты таков)
Выпей ещё бутылочку, если ты таков (Если ты таков)

Он когда-то был гангстером на своём районе

Эти чуваки треплются без умолку
Не вынимайте гроб из своего рта; я параноик, если мне летят угрозы
Эй-эй, за дело, бро
D-O-T, деньги, власть, уважение
Последнее — самое важное
Эй, так много дурачков с баблом на руках
Ну в смысле, а, надеюсь, что эти сантименты символичны
А, мой темперамент биполярен, я выбираю агрессию
Окей, поехали, пора ему доказать, какой он жёсткий
Чуваки объединяются, но ведут себя неискренне, никакого 40 Water, скажите им
А, йеа, ха, йеа, давай со мной
На хуй скрытые диссы, шутер от первого лица; надеюсь, там есть три переключателя
Я кричу: «На хуй рэп», запишу дисс на Мелли Мэла, если придётся

Потерял много бойцов, чтобы вести неосторожную игру

Думаете, я не скину адрес? У меня до сих пор ПТСР
В жопу большую троицу, блять, здесь большой только я

Чё? Я реально и есть таков
И твоя лучшая работа — это слабые потуги

Закинул Перк, рисковал на районе, словно в Неваде

Post Malone (Traducción al Español) Lyrics

Se suponía que me iban a enviar lejos
Pero se olvidaron de venir a buscarme
Yo era una alcohólica funcional
Hasta que nadie notó mi nueva estética
Todo esto para decir, espero que estés bien
Pero tú eres la razón
Y aquí nadie tiene la culpa
Pero, ¿qué pasa con tu silenciosa traición?

Y durante una quincena estuvimos corriendo para siempre
Hasta que a veces preguntas sobre el clima
Ahora еstás en mi patio trasero, nos convertimos еn buenos vecinos
Tu esposa riega flores, la quiero matar

Todas mis mañanas son lunes atrapados en un febrero interminable
Tomé el movimiento milagroso con las drogas, los efectos fueron temporales
Y te amo, está arruinando mi vida
Te amo, está arruinando mi vida
Te toqué solo por una quincena
Te toqué, pero te toqué

Y durante una quincena estuvimos corriendo para siempre
Hasta que a veces preguntas sobre el clima
Ahora estás en mi patio trasero, nos convertimos en buenos vecinos
Tu esposa riega flores, la quiero matar
Y durante una quincena estuvimos juntos corriendo
Hasta que a veces vienes y tiras de mi suéter
Ahora estás en el buzón convertido en buenos vecinos
Mi marido me engaña, lo quiero matar

Te amo, está arruinando mi vida
Te amo, está arruinando mi vida
Te toqué solo por quince días
Te toqué, te toqué
Te amo, está arruinando mi vida
Te amo, está arruinando mi vida
Te toqué solo por quince días
Te toqué, te toqué

Pensé en llamarte, pero no contestarás

Múdate a Florida, compra el auto que quieres
Pero no arrancará hasta que me toques, me toques, me toques

You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

First thing at dawn, you'd queue the songs and we'd get goin'

Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear

To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)

New truck, big lift
Old roads, we've been
Tearin' up since way back when
But these wheels are innocent
New hitch, new seats, no history
And you just can't fake that
So, let's change that

Girl, let's go put some miles on it

Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean

All tail, no gate
Ain't gotta try too hard
My baby's push to start
All torque, full speed
Off-road, on me
Zero to a hundred fast
My foot ain't touch the gas
I said, ""Hey, baby, slow it down, let's make it last""
You said, ""Where's the fun in that?""

Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath

The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down, I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running, but I'm standing still
Pray for peace, but I need thе thrill
So I keep chasing that same old devil

Ate but I will hit an eight year old in the face with a participation trophy

To shut me down so when I started this verse

But it feels like I'm targeted

How can I explain to you?

And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit

You gotta laugh at the stupidity

But you made me look so naive

Euphoria

Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale
A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now
You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you

Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee

Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay
Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay
I ain't thinkin' about no reaper, nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay
Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay
Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay
Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway
And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame
Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?
Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play
Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?
Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?
Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight
I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns
Then hop online like ""Pray for my city,"" he fakin' for likes and digital hugs
His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done
Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky
I'll park his son
The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way
I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted
What is it? The braids?
I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay
It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage
I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh
It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh
I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh
You know I got language barriers, huh
It's no accent you can sell me, huh
Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh
I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly
I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef
Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T
You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me
He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet
We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one
Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk


Remember?
Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?
Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch
I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous
Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
Surprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em
Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya
You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga
Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?
Ho, what? You ain't like that record?
""Back To Back,"" I like that record
I'ma get back to that, for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that
Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that
Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you
Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you
Am I battlin' ghost or AI?
Nigga feelin' like Joe Hale Osteen
Funny, he was in a film called A.I
And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him
I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin
Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America to imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie
I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie
Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas
I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm
Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food
Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too
If you take it there, I'm takin' it further
Psst, that's something you don't wanna do

My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are

He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are

I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are
(Oh, yeah)

Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back East
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave

Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, oh-oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed
And oh, oh-oh, they said he hit that guard rail at half past three
Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars
Out where the wild things are

In a holy water tide

Forty hours got me goin' out my mind
Dallas dropped another game in overtime
Caught a ticket speedin' down the 65
Don't know where I'm goin'

Guess I really went and messed it up again
Now, my baby's goner than the Tulsa wind
Judgin' by the stone-sober state I'm in
Need to crack one wide open

Somebody pour me a drink, somebody bum me a smoke
I'm 'bout to get on a buzz, I'm 'bout to get on a roll
Yeah, I've been breakin' my back just keepin' up with the Joneses
Y'all know what I mean, and y'all know how it goes
When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid, slide one over my way
I can't even think when I can hear one callin' my name (Hey)

Somebody pour me a drink
Pour me a drink

Bourbon-brown eyes tryna get me drunk
Ain't stoppin' 'til the bottle and the job is done
Hey, I think I might've found my future love

So when they ask, tell 'em

Right one, right place, wrong time

So bring your ass up down them stairs
I buy you shit because you rare

Ready to pop out, but we gotta lay low
I really gotta calm down
’Fore I end up in jeopardy just like the game show

I swear he's gassin' me up
There's no way in hell I see you passin' me up
Almost said I loved your ass right after we fucked
Don't know why, girl, it was on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, found someone I'm fallin' for
You hit me back, we're talkin' more now
The bodies that you caught before (They don't)
Make me mad or insecure (I'm good)

Two hundred on your fuckin' nails, for real

Вечное брожение в темноте
Из тьмы во мрак
Во всех сторонах повсюду чернота
О-а, с визгом пронеслась по небу
Остаётся просто лежать
Трахну суку, заставлю ее попотеть, ха, я умру за свой респект, ха
Повесил на шею один чек, жизнь в башку тебя чекнет

Почему я постоянно вижу твоих корешей в городе?
Наверное, твои ребята оставили бойцов позади
Как самолёт, который вы хотели купить
Такое у нас не пролетит, нет

Эти ребята со мной, словно спасательный круг
Привет моей бывшей, я её спаситель
Мой Глок лежит на моей тумбочке рядом
У тебя нет ствола на поясе, как и светового меча
В Сиэтле только я и Твизз
Ненавижу вас, парни, больше, чем когда-либо
Ты читаешь о том, чего никогда не делал

У тебя деньги забрали, будто забрали обед (Ха)
Мы недалеко от тебя, можем въебать
Сука, днём я сплю, солнца не вижу (Ага, йеа)
В большой Ламбо-тачке стоим под солнцем, поймаем тебя и поджарим
У тебя нет стиля, и что ты сделал?

Говорил со своим демоном и он сказал мне, что я всех обыграю

This is where it ends
I been down a few broken roads that I'm tryin' to mend
But this is where it ends
And I'm breakin' down
You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down

Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pridе to let that happen again
So this is wherе it ends

Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees
Red flags said I shoulda walked out that door

Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky

I got too much pride to let that happen again
So this is where it ends, ends, ends
Yeah, this is where it ends

You're the best thing that ever happened to me
You showed me what true love shouldn't be
I found myself the second I gave up on us

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose

Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

For a moment, I knew cosmic love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

For a moment, I was heavenstruck

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him","country, pop, female vocalists, singer-songwriter, acoustic"

Baby, you can find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up, don't you wanna just
Come along for the ride?
Ooh, my outfit so tight
You can see my heartbeat tonight
I can take the heat, baby, best believe
That's the moment I shine

'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Watch me dance, dance the night away
My hеart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dancе, dance the night away (Uh-huh)
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

Lately, I been movin' close to the edge
Still be lookin' my best
I stay on the beat, you can count on me
I ain't missin' no steps

'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Watch me dance, dance the night away
My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play safe (Ooh), don't you know about me? (Uh-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face
I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place (Yes, I can)
Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face (Yes, I can, yes, I can)
I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place

Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)
My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance (Dance), dance the night away (Uh-huh)
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)
