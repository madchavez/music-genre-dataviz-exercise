O tak
Mhm, mmm

Jak to możliwe? Ty i ja
Może tak miało być, nie da się tego odzobaczyć
Ale nie chcę powodować żadnej sceny
Zwykle nie sprawiam problemów
Taki niezależny, powiedz mi dlaczego
Bo chłopak jest mój, mój

Coś w nim jest stworzone dla kogoś takiego jak ja
Kochanie, podejdź, podejdź (Podejdź)
I Bóg jeden wie, że próbuję, ale nie ma sensu zaprzeczać

Chłopak jest mój
Nie mogę się doczekać, żeby go spróbować
Le-połączmy się
Gwiazdy, wyrównały się
Chłopak jest mój
Patrz, jak nie spieszę się (Patrz, jak nie spieszę się)
Nie mogę uwierzyć swojemu rozumowi (Nie mogę uwierzyć swojemu umysłowi)
Chłopak jest boski
Chłopak jest mój

Proszę, wiedz, że nie to planowałem
Prawdopodobnie nie postawiłbym na to ani grosza, ani swojego życia
Musi być jakiś powód
Moje dziewczyny zawsze radzą sobie w trudnych sytuacjach
Powiedz „Wszystko w porządku” (Wszystko w porządku)
Dzieje się cały czas

Coś w nim jest stworzone dla kogoś takiego jak ja
Kochanie, podejdź, podejdź (Podejdź)
I Bóg jeden wie, że próbuję, ale nie ma sensu przemawiać

Chłopak jest mój
Nie mogę się doczekać, żeby go spróbować
Le-połączmy się
Gwiazdy, wyrównały się
Chłopak jest mój
Patrz, jak nie spieszę się (Patrz, jak nie spieszę się)
Nie mogę uwierzyć swojemu rozumowi (Nie mogę uwierzyć swojemu umysłowi)
Chłopak jest boski
Chłopiec jest– (Chłopiec jest, och)

I wiem, że tak ma być i ja
Okażę ci odpowiedzialność, empatię i współczucie
Jak możesz być tak rozczarowany po takim czasie
Czas?
Mówiłem ci już raz, powiem ci jeszcze raz, chłopak nadal jest **mój, mój**

Tak, powiedział, że chce ze mną planować, ale nie wpieprzam się w sprawy, widzisz (wiem)
Ale posłuchaj, co mi mówią, **jeśli coś nie jest zepsute, to nie da się tego zepsuć**
(Bądź złamany)
No cóż, niech lepiej uporządkuje swoje sprawy, bo nigdy nie będę niczyją kochanką (Wiem, wiem, wiem)
Moje, moje, moje
Ale nie mogę zignorować swojego serca, chłopcze

Chłopiec jest mój (Mój)
Nie mogę się doczekać, żeby go spróbować (O tak, nie mogę się doczekać, żeby go wypróbować, ooh)
Le-połączmy się (połączmy się)
Gwiazdy, wyrównały się
Chłopiec jest mój (Mój)
Patrz, jak nie spieszę się
Nie mogę uwierzyć swojemu rozumowi
Chłopiec jest boski (Och, och)
Chłopiec jest mój (Mój, mój)
Nie mogę się doczekać, żeby go spróbować (Nie mogę się doczekać, żeby spróbować)
Le-połączmy się
Gwiazdy, one wyrównane (Gwiazdy)
Chłopiec jest mój (Och, woah, och)
Patrz, jak nie spieszę się (Och, patrz, jak nie spieszę się)

What kind of life would that be?
Oh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul

And if you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I, baby, I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you

If you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?

There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore

Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

Rose, you're the most amazingly astounding
Wonderful girl, woman, that I've ever known
I'm not an idiot, I know how the world works
But I'm too involved now
You jump, I jump, remember?

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls
Wearing this
Alright
Wearing only this

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'till
We're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always
Go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on (Why does the heart go on?)
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Go on, I'll get the next one
No, not without you
I'll be alright, listen, I'll be fine
I'm a survivor, alright? Don't worry about me
Now go on, get on

You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay
Forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You must promise me that you won't give up
No matter what happens
Promise me now, Rose
I promise
And never let go that promise
I will never let go, Jack
I'll never let go","pop, female vocalists, Canadian, 90s, french"

Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Usher talked about the relationship issues that led to this song’s concept:
‘I… Read More 
This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me (Make me, you're makin' me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, babe)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Oh yeah)
You make me, you make me

Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm fallin' for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go (Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it while all of this is goin' on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)

(Hey) You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Oh)
(Oh, you make, make, make me)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Ooh, oh, babe)
You make me wanna (Go on, babe, do your thing)
You make me wanna (Ooh, ooh-ooh yeah)

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)

And what I do? Be the Major League

And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door (Yeah)
Shotgun in my drop, having fun with the Don
System bassing, conversation (See what I mean?)
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, ""Give it to me now, baby""

You can't satisfy her needs

Don't check me (Check me)
It was your girl who let me (Let me)
Take it this far, then, ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Let her have it every chance that she could get

Boy, this evening, was it only me?
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feelin' this way
Especially the thought of gettin' in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinkin'

I should make a move but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

We were chillin', watching your TV
I thought you was coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow, in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carryin' on
Tryin' to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's gettin' too late
I'm thinkin'

I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (No way)
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night (I don't, I don't get down, baby)
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
(You're probably thinkin' something is wrong)
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

You got to know me (You got to know me)
And if you want my love (My love)

You got niggas that's mad 'cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me

But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit

Now, trick, what? Lace who? That ain't what Ma$e do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face, boo, not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny, never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit and make a nigga say, ""Rewind that""

Get your ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door

Adia, I do believe I failed you
Adia, I know I've let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way?
It's easy, let it go

Adia, I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong

There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

Adia, I thought that we could make it
I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
Your friend who won't betray

I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
I show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe

That we are born innocent

We are still innocent

Oh, all I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart

On the rooftop under the sky, oh
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside, oh

While you were asleep
I received a letter
But there was no addressee
So I paid it no mind, in fact
I wanted to send it back
But something that I was feeling
Said open it
It said, ""Dear reader
Once close friend of mine
Hope that this letter finds you in time
Cause your love is endin'
And my life's just beginnin'
With a woman that I know you hold dear to you""
And it made me wanna say

I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't, I don't)
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
I don't ever wanna see you again, (No, yeah)
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend? (Why?)
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

It took me a minute to wake up and see
What the love of my life was doin' to me
I wanted to lay down and die
Cause my pride wouldn't let me cry
But somehow I knew I had to get over it
He said he couldn't understand
Until he felt your touch
Now he can see why I love you so much
And that's so unfair
I never thought I'd have to share
Your love that I thought was given
To only me and that's why

I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't wanna see)
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
And I don't ever wanna see you again
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?

That you were messin' around with (Oh)
I didn't want to notice it (Yeah)

Cause I sure didn't see this one comin'

They say keep the one's you love close

And your enemy's even closer
But I can't win for losin', girl
(You were the closest thing to me baby)
Cause the one I thought was a friend to me
Ended up being my true enemy
(Knowin' all of the pain you caused me)
Listen to me, baby
I gave you everything
My love and my ring
And you violated me
And I don't wanna see you again

I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end (Yeah, yeah)
And my conscience is clear (so clear)
And I can move on from here (move on from here)

I wanna do my thing so we be established
And I don't want you rockin' them fabrics
Girl, I wanna give you carats 'til you feel you a rabbit

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same

Every time I make a run

I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother go to school in September
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, Jerry, wear his condom

New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam
Ho damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat
Splat, like deja vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
And beat her, niggas in the Bronx call me Lex
Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex, and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't no time to fold

New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

But if it wasn't for the Bronx

On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Recaro, two quarters of my life
Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharaoh, bought a new five
With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggas keep they own shadow
And I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggas rock gravel

Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded

From dusk 'til dawn and it's on, no doubt

And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth

The games I used to play, the girls that didn't last
I know what's on your mind, think I'm doin' wrong
Can I say what is real? You are the only one
When I'm not around, do you think of me?
Or what the jealous ones are claimin' me to be
You should know by now, that it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you for us to make it through

You should know, baby, you're my angel
Nothing's gonna make you fall from Heaven
Girl, I just want to love you, love you

That I'm a selfish man, want my cake and eat it to
Maybe in my past but you changed me now
Now that I've learned to love, it's you that showed me how
Your love so real I'd be a fool to play
Play around on you, I want to stay with you
You should know by now that it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you for us to make it through

You should know it, you're my angel

Nigga, I'm the colonel of the motherfuckin tank
Y'all after big thangs, we after big bank
3rd Ward hustlas, soldiers in combat
Convicts and dealers, and killers with TRU tats
Never gave a fuck bout no hoes on our riches
And niggas come short, I'm diggin ditches
M.P. pullin stripes, commander-in-chief
And fools run up wrong, nigga I'm knockin out some teeth
I'm down here slangin, rollin with these hustlers
Tryin to get rid of all you haters and you bustas
Steppin on toes, break a niggas nose
In the projects niggas anything goes
Breakin fools off cause I'm a No Limit soldier
At ease now salute, this pass me the doja

Make em say uhh (uhh)

Fiend exercisin his right of exorcism, bustin out the Expedition
Bullets choppin haters business to about the size of prisms our mission

No tellin how bad it get, because the worst'll vary
I heard you make em worry, that this for the loot
They intimidated by the rounds that the tank shoot
Tank Dogs salute! Every robbery in store, cause they know
Everything Fiend know, mean mo' money mo'
Little Fiend still want the greens, the cornbread and the cabbage
In your hood, remindin you bitches of who the baddest
Definitely the maddest, so the crime gon' stick em up

Silkk, you the type of nigga that promotes violence? You might be right
Cause I'll step in the club and say somethin
To get that motherfucker start to, fightin!! (Bout it!!)
Bad as Vogues, I'm cold, extra see through
Be G's fuckin knockin niggas cause I make em all see 3-D

And cocked, we got the industry locked, we can't be stopped, too hot

This Tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes
Want some mo? Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mamma Mia
The Unlady Like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away
So stay in yo' place, when ya hear mamma speakin
Cannon spray, clear the way, when ya see The Tank creepin

A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so
I need to know what I've done wrong
And how long it's been going on
Was it that I never paid enough attention
Or did I not give enough affection?
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again
You can tell me to my face
Or even on the phone
You can write it in a letter
Either way, I have to know
Did I never treat you right?
Did I always start the fight?
Either way, I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions, I have to find

My head's spinning
Boy, I'm in a daze

Don't wanna communicate

I will roam

It's like Romeo and Juliet
Hot sex on a platta' just to get you wet
You's about to get in somthin' you will never regret
And it's gonna be the bomb this is what I bet
Yep!
Since the first time I saw ya
I knew I was attracted
Reacted to the fact
On how ya make me act
Shy but sexy at the same time
Always on my mind was a little bump and grind
Usually I don't play it that close
You got's to kick it wit me
Before I serve you up
With an overdose
Of that bomb-ass puh-nanny
Make you my man
I ain't got no love
For nobody else but you

Cuz you's my boo
I prove to you
My love be true
So do you know where you goin' to
Through thick and thin, baby
You all in, time will reveal
That my love for you will never end
My heart keep tickin'
No time for trickin'
You who I'm pickin'
So lay me down
Just give it a good lickin'
I'll treat you like my king
Cuz you royal
And only give my love to you
Because I'm loyal, escape with me
Come over to my place
I'll teach you a few things in love makin'
Now I can't wait, I won't wait
So take me by my arms and rock me baby
Cuz I'mma always and forever be yo lady
Repeat 1

After our first night
You discovered who's the bombest mommy
L.A.'s finest with my top dogs all around me
Down to ride, harder than Bonnie and Clyde
We're sexual healers, do ya feel this
Baby, check my vibe
They'll never be a love like me
That got your back in this industry
That got your back in these streets
So you don't have to worry 'bout me
On the creep
And I don't want you ever to try to
Play me cheap
Cuz I don't sleep around
Because it's sleezy
Good lesson taught by my big homey E-Z
I got to compliment you on how you please me
Touch me, but don't tease me
Now put it in nice and easy
And rub my body down I'm feeling wheezy
And cuddle up to me
Cuz now I'm getting sleepy
But I'mma be dedicated
To this relation
So stay away from all them cowboys
So we can not be playa hated

Cuz if you wit me boo, then keep it real
And if I catch you sleepin' around
Then I'm gon' have to chill
When ya find good love
You best to keep it
I'm puttin' all my sista's up on game

It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me
Saying ""Get back together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me, but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know the vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry


Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on, we're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films
'Kay, I don't make films, but if I did they'd have a samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gonna get in tune with Sailor Moon 'cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes that make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

She lives for me, says she lives for the ovation
Her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I'll make you smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give 'em the games she play, she say

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

How do I get back there to
The place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else

Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly face down on the mattress
One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still, it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, heavy on the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want something else

Dissin' every year, but they better listen here
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on your own
'Cause bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone
Plus it won't be long 'til they send me the dome
Sit gently while I'm on the Bentley phone
Why you don't like me, 'cause I'm mad fly and icy?
And why you can't satisfy your wifey?
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure
CD, TV's, really would I know ya?
Now me and Blink float in a gold Rover
So it's only right you get the cold shoulder
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed
'Cause Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it

We was all at the Greek Fest, it's hot and sandy
I rent scooters, I'm with my family
Tank top, flip flop, really nothing fancy
But get approached by a girl named Tammy
Who look good enough to be Miss Miami
But say since some her peeps call her Candy
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's
""He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties?""
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties?
Please, tell me something that I don't know
Like if we have sex, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem, you can meet me at 10
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie
And please no hickies, 'cause wifey's with me

Look at the sky
Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me
The heavens are sparkling
With starlight tonight
That's what I see through your eyes
I see the heavens
Each time that you smile
I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see through your eyes

Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop
What we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes

I look at myself
And instead I see us
Whoever I am now
It feels like enough
And I see a girl
Who is learning to trust
That's who I see through your eyes

Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop
What we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes

And there are some things we don't know
Sometimes a heart just needs to go
And there is so much
I'll remember
Underneath the open sky with you forever

Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop
What we have begun
And love just took me by surprise

Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by

Have you ever felt a breeze hit your heart
Like the wind was blowin' it apart (blowin' it apart)
As you're spinnin' like a merry-go-round
Indications of a storm touchin' down
I wish that I could weather any storm
But I guess it was a heartbreak from the norm
Was a day I will always remember
The saddest day in sweet November

Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)

Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)

Hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
And you said, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

And you will find me

If you fall, I will catch you

And darkness has turned to gray

Some got hopes and dreams, we got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme

Who the hell wanna stop me? I hated those who doubt me

Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Tryna find what's really going on in the streets

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo

When the chief away that's when them cats want to play

Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see, I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

It's all (It's all) It's all because of you

Baby I really know by now
Since we met that day
You showed me the way
I felt it then, you gave me love, I can't describe
How much I feel for you
I said baby I should have known by now
Should have been right there whenever you gave me love
And if only you were here
I'd tell you yes I'd tell you (oh yeah)


Honestly, could it be you and me
Like it was before neither less or more
'Cause when I close my eyes at night
I realize that no one else could ever take your place
I still can feel and it's so unreal
When you're touching me, kisses endlessly
It's just a place in the sun where our love's begun
I miss you, yes I miss you baby, oh yeah


If I knew how to tell you what's on my mind

When in the springtime of the year
When the trees are crowned with leaves
When the ash and oak and the birch and yew
Are dressed in ribbons fair
When owls call the breathless moon
In the blue veil of the night
The shadows of the trees appear
Amidst the lantern light

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

Who will go down to those shady groves
And summon the shadows there?
And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms
In the springtime of the year
The songs of birds seem to fill the wood
That when the fiddler plays
All their voices can be heard
Long past their woodland days

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
And now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

And so they linked their hands and danced
Round in circles and in rows
And so the journey of the night descends
When all the shades are gone
A garland gay, we bring you here
And at your door, we stand
It is a sprout well-budded out
The work of our Lord's hand

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
And now returning back again
We bring a garland gay
We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
And now returning back again

Outside I see the rain is fallin', whoa oh
Inside I'm slowly dyin'
But the rain will hide my cryin', cryin', cryin'

Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused

Is it too late for me to find my way home?
How could I be so wrong?

I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
Now lay your head on my chest and feel my heartbeat

Once I put the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin, I don't care

Rubbin' your spot, love, got you screamin', ""Punish me!""

Hahaha, ahahaha, hey, man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha (A sucker for love)

I should've seen you was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began, we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems, but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I opened up the door with your jealous questions
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucker for love

What you won't do, do for love? (That's right, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy, you tried to trap me
Said you're pregnant and guess who the daddy? Don't wanna fall for it
But in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryna keep it true
What if I'm wrong? A trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryna be strong and in the process, keep it goin'
I'm 'bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head, I'm feelin' low, losin' control
My heart is sayin', ""Leave!"" Oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear, 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the door
Never no more you will see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucker for love
What you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Don't, sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love? (Oh, yeah, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Oh, baby)

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hopin' the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you, a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it, we can do it now, I'm under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery
Replace it with happiness but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love

Y'all got the nerve to wanna P.H.D. me
Cuz I'm making all the money
HA HA HA HA HA

While y'all ride Matchbox, I push the Hot Wheels

Lettin' champagne spills on my house in the grill
And all I'm about is the dolla' dolla' bill
Makin' ya' dance every chance I get
And hata's sayin' damn, will he ever catch bricks?
Nah, I don't catch those, keep it ghetto
Seen wit' the best hoes, on the east and the west coast

Now, e'where I pass
They wanna see the big booty mamma
Tapping some ass
And whether you believe it or not

Keep it heated stay undefeated from the Chi comma Illinois
My crew make more noise than yours
Fifteen a night on tour, make 'em sick with no cure
As she sits by the bar she sips Cristies
In the midst of the party they bump hits by JD
The B.R.A.T., we the element
And you irrelevant
Get down off this shit

I don't pay attention to ya' hatin' and ya' bad looks
Just think about gettin' paper like Garth Brooks
Keep it off the hook
Let the world feel the touch
Y'all doing too much, sayin' y'all can see us
It's like this here

In the six, pretty bitches with the long hair

Listen, dear
I realise that you've been hurt, deep
Because I've been there
But regardless to who, what, why, when and where
We're all precious in his sight
And a rose is still, and always will be, a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
She never knew what hit her, oh
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else
And now you're so tough, tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh, oh, yeah
When she gets nearer
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Don't believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself enough to know
That without him, your life goes on
Without him, your life goes on
And without him, your life goes on

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
My life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow (I imagine)
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe (When spring)
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of (Oh, I)
The scent of your perfume (I imagine when summer burns)
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you (Ooh)
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do (When autumn sheds)
When autumn sheds, the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

Remember
The nights when (Remember the night)
We closed our eyes (When we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

Every time I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional (I get so emotional)

This loneliness has crushed my heart (It's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

I swear to tell the truth and nothin but the truth
So help me, God
I just felt like tellin' the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that

If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped, my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple, pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms, smoked lye, drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a ****
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms, 'cause she's talkin' on the phone, come on

Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't takin these whippin's no mo'
I wanna live to see my little Todd grow""

Lookin' down at me standin on the staircase

Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin' me? (I'm feelin you)

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty, left Long Isle for Queens
Possesed by a demon, a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around, heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me ****?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screamin', I can't forget that

Anyway, pops dissapeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother

Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray

Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'

And I got you thinkin' 'bout it, thinkin' 'bout it
Thinkin' bout it, thinkin' 'bout it

For the life of me, I just can't conceive
Why I just can't leave while you do this to me, baby
I feel like a fool, but what can I do?
Your love's got me weak, babe
Why must I endure your constant greed
Your endless need to be so damn freaky?
Now I'll understand, 'cause it was just me
I guess payback's a mother, baby
Oh, why, why, why, why, why, why
Tell me why, why are you so freaky?
Tell me why are you so freaky.  Oh
All this time I've been sleepin' with you
You've been sleepin' with me
And you've been strokin' him and lovin' him
And kissin' him and lovin' him
Oh, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
You've been creepin' with him
He's been sexin' your friend
And I got you thinkin' 'bout it, thinkin' 'bout it
Thinkin' 'bout it, thinkin' 'bout it
G's got you (Thinkin' about it.)
I got you thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
(Thinkin' about it.) Got you thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
(About it, baby.) Said I got you thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
Oh baby, ooh baby, oh baby
Said I got you (Thinkin' about it.)
I got you thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
(Thinkin' about it.) Keep on thinkin', thinkin', thinkin, baby
(About it, baby.) Oh, oh, oh
Thinkin' about it, babe.  Thinkin' about it, baby
Hey, hey
Why must I endure (Thinkin' about it, baby.)
Your constant greed, (Thinkin' about it, baby.)
Your endless need to be oh so damn freaky?  (About it, baby.)
Guess I understand, 'cause it was just me
(Thinkin' about it, baby.) Said I got you thinkin'
(Thinkin' about it, baby.) Thinkin'.  Oh, ho.  Oh, ho
(About it, baby.) Oh baby.  Ooh yeah
Oh.  Thinkin'
Said you're thinkin'
(Thinkin' about it, baby.) Thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', baby
(Thinkin' about it, baby.) Sayin' I got you thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
(About it, baby.) Got you thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
Thinkin', just thinkin'

Thinkin' about it, baby
Thinkin' about it, baby
About it, baby
Thinkin' about it, baby
Thinkin' about it, baby
About it, baby
Thinkin' about it, baby
Thinkin' about it, baby
About it, baby
Thinkin' about it, baby
Thinkin' about it, baby
About it, baby","rnb, soul, gerald levert, quiet storm, male vocalists"

How did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart said, ""No, no""
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind, my mind, my mind

I've spent all my life on a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again, love has knocked me down
My heart got broken, oh, it hurts so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again

So, I placed my heart under lock and key (Ooh, yeah)
To take some time and take care of me (Mm-hmm)
But I turn around and you're standing here

How did you get here? (Get here)
Nobody's supposed to be here (Mm-hmm, nobody's supposed to be here)
I've tried that love thing for the last time (Oh)
My heart said, ""No, no"" (No)
Nobody's supposed to be here (Nobody's supposed to be here, but)
But you came along and changed my mind, my mind, my mind

This time, I swear I'm through
But if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I've cried, this lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things

So, I placed my heart under lock and key (Ooh, yeah)
To take some time and take care of me (Mm-hmm)
But I turn around and you're standing here

(How did you)
Standing here, oh yeah! (How did you get here?)
No, nobody
No, no, no, no, no, no (Surely, nobody's supposed to be here)
Woo! (In here)
Nobody (Nobody), mmm
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No!

How did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here (Yeah, oh yeah)
I've tried that love thing for the last time (I've tried it over and over, and my)
My heart said, ""No, no"" (My heart said, ""No, no, no, no!"")
Nobody's supposed to be here (Nobody's supposed to be here)
But you came along and changed my mind, my mind, my mind (Came along and you changed me)
How did you get here? (I'm not supposed to love again)
Nobody's supposed to be here (I'm not supposed to care anymore)
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart said, ""No, no"" (No, no, no, no, oh, no)
Nobody's supposed to be here (No, no, no, no, oh, no)
But you came along and changed my mind","rnb, soul, female vocalists, pop, dance"
99,100,"""Westside""",TQ,"23 ContributorsWestside Lyrics
This is goin' out
To the whole wide Westside
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah
Break it down for me
Steady Mobbin (Rock) rock on

I was just a young boy livin' in the Hub City
Eastside Compton, G
Back in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy
Had every nigga talkin' 'bout, ""Boy, you can't fuck with me""
Remember Ice-T had the power (Ooh, wee)
Hearin' gunshots lickin' by the hour
When Too $hort bumped in every supersport
And told us all how to ride for the West Coast

To my peoples, if you hear me, where you at, throw your dubs in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say
All day, every day, any damn day
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
Goin' on and on, it don't stop, won't stop, can't stop
You could ride or die
That's why I put it down for the Westside

Didn't seem that long ago (Oh, no)
We were stealin' forties out the liquor store (Oh, no)
Mama started trippin', so it's time to go
Mob to the park with the locstas
Everybody broke smokin' roaches
DJ Quik was the shit
Had every nigga claimin' he was from the CPT
Y'all remember
One time tried to clown
We had to burn this bitch on down

One time for my niggas in incarceration (ooh, yeah)
I blaze a dime with you for havin' lots of patience
Two times for my sisters at the county building
I got some westside love for all you ghetto children
Three times for my niggas that done passed away
I tip some gin for you and pray for better days
One day everything's gonna be fine
But until that day my only reply
Is ""westside till I die""

To my peoples, if you hear me, where you at, throw your dubs in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say
All day, every day, any damn day
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
Goin' on and on, it don't stop, won't stop, can't stop
You could ride or die
Got to give it up for the westside

From Crenshaw to Foothill Boulevard
All I see is lolos in mob cars, Daytons and Five Stars
All the true hoes is hittin' switches with all the finest riches
Of course the bombest bitches, don't get it twisted
Ask me what's a real G
Show me a nigga scrappin' back against the wall until his knuckles bleed
Screamin' death to all our enemies and those who don't believe
West Coast livin' be the shit to me

One time for my niggas in incarceration (ooh, yeah)
I blaze a dime with you for havin' lots of patience
Two times for my sisters at the county building
I got some love for all you little ghetto children
Three times for my niggas that done passed away
I tip some gin for you and pray for better days
One day everything's gonna be fine
But until that day my only reply
Is ""westside till I die""

To my peoples, if you hear me, where you at, throw your dubs in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say
All day (All day), every day (Every day), any damn day (Any damn day)
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
Goin' on and on (Goin' on and on), it don't stop (And on and on), won't
Stop, can't stop
You could ride or die
You got to give it up for the Westside

To my peoples, if you hear me, where you at (Whoa...whoa...whoa...)
Throw your dubs in the air, wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say
All day, every day (Every day), any damn day (Any damn day)
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
Goin' on and on (Goin' on and on), it don't stop (And on and on), won't
Stop (And on and on), can't stop
You could ride or die
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
To my peoples, if you hear me, where you at, throw your dubs in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say
All day (All day), every day (Every day), any damn day (Any damn day)
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
Goin' on and on, it don't stop, won't stop, can't stop
You could ride or die
TQ gon' give it up for the Westside
To my peoples, if you hear me, where you at, throw your dubs in the air
Wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say
All day, every day, any damn day
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down
Goin' on and on, it don't stop, won't stop, can't stop
You could ride or die
Got to give it up for the Westside
