Late December, back in '63

And my, as I recall

She was only sixteen, only sixteen

But she was too young to fall in love

And it made our hearts glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

So why did I give my heart so fast, it never will happen again
But I was a mere child of sixteen, I've aged a year since then

She was only sixteen, only sixteen
Ooh with eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

So why did I give my heart so fast, it never will happen again
But I was a mere child of sixteen, I've aged a year since then

Now she was only sixteen, only sixteen

So, let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing through the moonlit nights with your lover

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candlelights
Must be the season when those love rights shine all around us

So, let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face, you can't hold back

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean

When your body's had enough of me
And I'm layin' flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more

Come on over here and lay by my side
I've got to be touchin' you
Let me rub your tired shoulders
The way I used to do

Look into my eyes and give me that smile
The one that always turns me on
And let me take your hair down
Cause we're stayin' up to greet the sun

And when your body's had enough of me
And I'm layin' flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more

Got to say a few things that have been on my mind
And you know where my mind has been
I guess I learned my lessons
And now's the time to begin

So if you're feelin' alright and you're ready for me
I know that I'm ready for you
We better get it on now
Cause we got a whole life to live through

And when your body's had enough of me
And I'm layin' flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you choose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old time you use it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got to be rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you choose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old time you use it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got to be rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could hear my man a-wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they was blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you choose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old time you use it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got to be rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

They started playing that rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you choose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you use it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got to be rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Say, if you want to dance with me

What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife?
You count up the years
And they will be filled with tears
Love only breaks up to start over again
You'll get the babies
But you won't have your man
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh

Say I'm gonna leave
A hundred times a day
It's easier said than done
When you just can't break away
(Just can't break away)

Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

It's high time now, just one crack at life
Who wants to live in trouble and strife
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mmm
I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they say
Self-preservation is what's really going on today

Say I'm gonna turn loose
A thousand times a day
How can I turn loose
When I just can't break away
(When I just can't break away)

Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
You and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
It don't love you
Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you
Oh! Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh! Young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you
Oh! Young hearts run free

Breaking up is hard to do

Don't take your love away from me!
Don't you leave my heart in misery?
If you go, then I'll be blue!
'Cuz breaking up is hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now, I know, I know that it's true!
Don't say that this is the end!
Instead of breaking up, I wish we were making up again

I beg of you, don't say goodbye!
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on, baby, let's start a new!

The song peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1976, making it his only chart appearance to date. It also reached #48 in Canada.You know I love that organic cooking
I always ask for more
And they call me Mr. Natural
On down to the health food store
I only eat good sea salt
White sugar don't touch my lips
And my friends is always
Begging me to take them
On macrobiotic trips
Yes, they are
Oh, but at night I take out my strongbox
That I keep under lock and key
And I take it off to my closet
Where nobody else can see
I open that door so slowly
Take a peek up north and south
Then I pull out a Hostess Twinkie
And I pop it in my mouth
Yeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me

Well, at lunchtime
You can always find me
At the Whole Earth Vitamin Bar
Just sucking on my plain white yogurt
From my hand thrown pottery jar
And sippin' a little hand pressed cider
With a carrot stick for dessert
And wiping my face in a natural way
On the sleeve of my peasant shirt
Oh, yeah
Ah, but when that clock strikes midnight
And I'm all by myself
I work that combination
On my secret hideaway shelf
And I pull out some Fritos corn chips
Dr. Pepper and an Ole Moon Pie
Then I sit back in glorious expectation
Of a genuine junk food high
Oh yeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me

My friends down at the commune
They think I'm pretty neat
Oh, I don't know nothing about arts and crafts
But I give 'em all something to eat
I'm a friend to old Euell Gibbons
And I only eat homegrown spice
I got a John Keats autographed Grecian urn
Filled up with my brown rice
Yes, I do
Oh, but folks lately I have been spotted
With a Big Mac on my breath
Stumbling into a Colonel Sanders
With a face as white as death
I'm afraid someday they'll find me
Just stretched out on my bed
With a handful of Pringles Potato Chips
And a Ding Dong by my head
In the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
