I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face, and I've
Never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
And baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

'Cause I can feel you breathe, washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
And baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe


Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
And baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?

You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

Well, I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave, it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word

Out from the barrio

Turnin' you 'round and 'round

Somewhere there's speaking, it's already coming in
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away the
Anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

I am everything you want, I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things at exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you, and I don't know why

Say my name, say my name

Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Better say my name

Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, yeah, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holdin' you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name (Say my name, is around you)

What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now sayin' you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your game when you cannot say my name

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces (I'm searching for)
I think I found my way home

I know that it might sound more than a little
Crazy, but I believe...

When dreaming, I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate

It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know, if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal
Yeah

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one
Yeah, yeah

It's so incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would've made it very far
'Cause you know you've got the keys to my heart
'Cause

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the dark of night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and
Four, repeat steps one through three

Everything in this world that a man could want

Still, I'm lonely now

From their covers to my covers, wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find

I wasn't sure that I was

But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all

Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror
So how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this shit day after day?
Now how did we wind up this way
Watching our mouths for the words that we say?
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes or the soles that we choose
How do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her
When she smiles


Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
A pretty face she hid from the world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs

This desert rose, ya leil, ya leil
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns, ya leil, ya leil
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns, ya leil, ya leil
I realize that nothing's as it seems

I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, ya leil, ya leil
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

Aman, aman, aman
Omry feek antia
Ma ghair antia
Ma ghair antia

I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

Sweet desert rose, ya leil, ya leil
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil
This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam; like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush that I just did not want
Paid, was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, getting paid was everything

But I'm not every girl, and I don't need that world to validate me
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be giving you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream

But I'm not every girl, and I don't need no G to take care of me
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no, no

You never try me
Always stood right by me
Make living lively highly
Spoken of, my only love, the only one
You're my wifey

Sweet—but you know when to flip it street
Freak—but only when it comes to me
See—that’s why you’re my wifey

This you should know
'Cause you had my mind blown, oh, oh
Da jump, at the club on bump, like what
I had to have you babe
Saw you outside, passenger side
'Cause I let my best friend drive
You was in line
That's when you caught my eyes girl

You were so beautiful, girl (Beautiful)
It was so critical, girl (So critical)
You looked so crucial, girl

Someone to have my kids
The one I can depend on

Will figure out why they get so mad

'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts

It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

And I wish I never met her at all (Met her at all)
Even though I love her so
But she got love for me, mmm
But she still belongs to someone else

It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me, oh
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

And I wish I never met her at all (Met her at all)
Even though I love her so
And she got love for me, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, uh
But she still belongs to someone else

Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22 (Catch-22)
Either way it went
Someone had to lose

And I wish I never met her at all, oh, oh (Met her at all)
Even though I love her so

She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful
Smokes a pack a day
Wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey
She thinks I'm beautiful

Well, meet Virginia

She never compromises
Loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful?

Meet Virginia

Well, she wants to be the queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
""I don't really wanna be the queen""

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
And brother is a fine mediator
For the President
And here she is again on the phone
Just like me, hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the President

Meet Virginia, alright

Well, she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
""I don't really wanna live this life""

No more, no more
No more, no more

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite
Unusual
You see, her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body?
Unusual

Well, meet Virginia, I can't wait to

Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely

Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)

With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani

I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew

Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky

And I, I was walkin' the clouds

The only joy that I have ever known
Girl, they were lyin'
Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Have just given up, they wanna let it go
But we're still tryin'

So you should know this love we share was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one-way street, just you and I
Just you and I

'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again
All over again

Some people say
That everything has got its place in time
Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buyin'
'Cause in your eyes
I see a love that burns eternally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You'll know I'm not lyin'

Sure, there'll be times we wanna say goodbye, but even if we try
There are some things in this life won't be denied
Won't be denied

And the more that I'm sure I want you forever and ever more
And the more that you love me, the more that I know

Loneliness up ahead
Emptiness behind, where do I go?

And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know
Still, I miss you somehow?

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still, I wish you were here now

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know (A thing or two you gotta know)
And you were my first love
You were my first love (First love), you were my true love

When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment, please
To tame your wild wild heart
I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief
And people can be so cold

When darkness is upon your door
And you feel like you can't take anymore

Let me be the one you call
If you jump, I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash, then crash and burn
You're not alone

When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one way street
With the monsters in your head

When hopes and dreams are far away
And you feel like you can't face the day

Let me be the one you call
If you jump, I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash, then crash and burn
You're not alone

'Cause there has always been heartache and pain
And when it's over, you'll breathe again
You'll breathe again

When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment, please
To tame your wild, wild heart

Let me be the one you call
If you jump, I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash, then crash and burn
You're not alone
Let me be the one you call
If you jump, I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash, then crash and burn
You're not alone
Let me be the one you call (Ooh)
If you jump, I'll break your fall (You're not alone)
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night (No, no, you're not alone)
If you need to fall apart (Ooh)

She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said ""yes""
And I said ""wow""
She said ""when""
And I said ""how about right now""
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said ""yes""
And I said ""wow""
She said ""when""
And I said ""how about right now""
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So I called the preacher, family, and friends
And nothin's been the same since

She said ""yes""
And I said ""wow""
She said ""when""
And I said ""how about right now""

Then I asked if she believed in fate

With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back
When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore
Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life
His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane
When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
'Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
About the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life
Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown
He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now its me and her

I just left my baby girl a message
Sayin', ""I won't be comin' home, I'd rather be alone""
She doesn't fully understand me
'Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time, I can be the man she needs
But there's a lotta lust inside of me and we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need
Some time to be alone

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's cryin' her heart to me, how could you let this be?
I just need time to see where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee
I don't mean to hurt you, baby
Oh, no, no

Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part in a decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
Or think about my life and what matters to me the most?
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not sayin' I'm gone, but I
Have to find what life is like without you

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave

Hey, I was always the crazy one, broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the fifty-yard line
You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian so
Under your number, I wrote ""call for a good time""
I only wanted to get your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides, you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud
How do you like me now?

How do you like me now, now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me, but I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio, how do you like me now?

When I took off to Tennessee, I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money, girl, ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing, who could that be singin'?
It's me, baby, with your wake-up call
How do you like me now?

How do you like me now, now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me, but I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio, how do you like me now? Yeah

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be

Waiting for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls
Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world like it's someplace that you've been

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, 'round here

A little bit weaker than you used to be

Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me

The sign in the window said for sale or trade
On the last remaining dinosaur Detroit made
Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

And that road rolls out like a welcome mat
I don't know where it goes but it beats where we're at
We always said someday, somehow
We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town

What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?

We've been puttin' this off baby long enough
Just give me the word, and we'll be kickin' up dust
We both know it's just a matter of time
'Til our hearts start racin' for that county line

What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?

We could hang around this town forever making plans
But there won't ever be a better time to take this chance

What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?

Prayin', all my love, emotions

And I don't know what it takes to let you know you're my girl
To let you know you're my baby

If they only knew that we were meant to be together
Forever and ever, whatever, there's no better thing

Sometimes I wanna be the one
You be checkin' for, can I get a second for
Me and you to be alone?
Tell me if you think it's wrong
Love is nothin' but the time it takes to say, ""I'm on your mind""
Let me tell you, I'm always there, oh, yeah

Meet me at the finish line so I can tell you one more time

Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you

We sat down, made an agreement
We vowed that, that we'd always
Be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never, ever leave us
That was awhile ago
But now lately it feels like, I mean, I feel like
All we do is fight every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back and take it way back
All the way back, can we start again?
Do it over, can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?

I just wanna praise You (Just wanna praise You)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise You (Woah, woah)
I'm gonna praise You

Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gon' lose my mind
And Lord, I know You wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need You to lift this load
'Cause I can't take it no more

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (So I can dance)
I just wanna praise You (Woo, woo, woah)
I just wanna praise You (Yeah, hey)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (Woo, yeah, yeah)
And I'm gonna praise You (I'm gonna, I'm gonna)
I'm gonna praise You (I'm gonna praise You)

Been through the fire and the rain
Bound in every kind of way
But God has broken every chain
So, let me go right now

Take the shackles off my feet, so I can dance (So I can dance, y'all)
I just wanna praise You (Woah, woo-woo, oh)
I just wanna praise You (I wanna praise You)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise You (Praise You)
I'm gonna praise You (Praise You, praise You, yeah)
Take the shackles off my feet (Yeah, yeah, yeah), so I can dance ('Cause I just wanna)
I just wanna praise You ('Cause I just wanna)
I just wanna praise You (Yeah, yeah)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise You (Praise You, yeah)
I'm gonna praise You (Come on, dance with me)
Take the shackles off my feet, so I can dance (I just wanna praise You)
I just wanna praise You ('Cause I'm free tonight)
I just wanna praise You (Yes, I'm free, yeah)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise You (Yeah, praise You)
I'm gonna praise You (Yeah, praise You)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Take 'em off, take 'em off
What you gonna do? What, yeah!
What you do then, yeah?
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
Broke all the chains
And I'm gonna praise You
What you gonna do?
I'm gonna praise You
What you gonna do? What!","gospel, christian, female vocalists, rnb, Contemporary Gospel"
