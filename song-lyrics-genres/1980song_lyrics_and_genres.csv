What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive

Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy 'til you spend a lot of money

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound funny
But it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the Miracle Mile?

Nowadays, you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental

Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town, but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
Well you could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance

Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You'd get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers

That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need

And you, its only seed

It's the heart, afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Far beneath the bitter snows

In the spring becomes the rose","female vocalists, pop, 80s, rock, singer-songwriter"

I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read

If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad

Yes, I like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape
So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, ""Aw, it's you""
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, ""I never knew""

That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape

If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga

Ride like the wind

I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

And I've got such a long way to go (Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Gonna ride like the wind

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go (Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
And I've got a long way to go (Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Gonna ride like the wind

It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all
I do love you
Still

Times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had
Sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind
So many dreams that flow away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love You

And if the wind is right, you can find the joy
Of innocence again

Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be

Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look, old yella's leavin'""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky"" as he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man

Everyone considered him the coward of the county","country, classic country, kenny rogers, male vocalists, oldies"

Hmmm, hmmm hmmm
Oooh oooh ooh
It's raining, it's pouring
My love life is boring me to tears
After all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight
No stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I always dreamed I'd find the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
I've loved
I've loved

Raining (Raining)
Pouring (Pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear
Ah ah ah hey hey ah

If you've had enough
Don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it

If you've had your fill
Get the check, pay the bill
You can do it

Tell him to just get out

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat, show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough (Enough)
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough (Enough)
I've loved
I've loved
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

If you've reached the end
Don't pretend that is right when it's over

(It's over)
If the feeling is gone
Don't think twice just move on
Get it over

Tell him to just get out
Say it clearly, spell it out:
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now
Enough is enough

But he turned out to be like every other man

I've loved (I've gotta listen to my heart)
I've loved (Tearing us apart)

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now
Enough is enough

I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

And can only happen in make believe stories

Used to think that life was sweet
Used to think we were so complete
I can't believe you'd throw it away

Used to feel we had it made
Used to feel we could sail away
Can you imagine how I feel today?

Well, it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done?

Well, it really doesn't matter to me
I guess your leaving was meant to be
It's down to you now, you wanna be free

Well, I hope you know which way to go
You're on your own again
And don't come crying to me
When you're the lonely one

Steppin' out, the weekend's open wide
Fill it up, let's blast the jams and ride
While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five, that's the place we've arrived, it's alive

Old ones, young things, short ones standing tall
So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone

Seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely
She was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness
With the radio playin' low, and
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn
And nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me, oh-so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

And the years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home and I
I guess I lost my way
There were oh-so many roads
I was livin' to run
And runnin' to live
Never worried about payin'
Or even how much I owed

Movin' eight miles a minute
For months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind


Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about

What to leave out

Behind the masquerade, the tears are there

Come on out beneath the shining sun
Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Sneak on out beneath the stars and run

It's king and queen and we must go down now
Beyond the chandelier
Where I won't have to speak my mind
And you won't have to hear
Shreds of news and afterthoughts
And complicated scenes
We'll weather down behind the light
And fade like magazines
Hey, love is alright now

Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Hey, hey, meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Let me smell the moon in your perfume

Oh now, meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay

Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings

The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and we rise
Wipe the sleep out of our eyes

Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?

I once thought of you
As a white knight on a steed
Now you know how happy we can be
Oh, when our good times started then
With a dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need?

Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh, what can it mean

No, I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted
Time won't heal a broken hearted me","country, female vocalists, pop, Canadian, classic country"

All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see, all the things life can be, shining soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life","country, classic country, kenny rogers, male vocalists, oldies"

How are the tenders, Johnny?

Why don't you ask him if he's gonna stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?

Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?

Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him the latest on his throne?

I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
It's kind of funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe, yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah

I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come… running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long, make you shout
Oh, lover!
Yeah, I wanna be the only one you come for

I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
And I get discouraged
'Cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you, I just go wild, woo!

I didn't wanna pressure you, baby, no
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come… running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out

95,96,"""In America""",Charlie Daniels Band,"9 ContributorsIn America Lyrics
Well the eagle's been flying slow
And the flag's been flying low
And a lot of people saying that America's fixing to fall
Well speaking just for me
And some people from Tennessee
We've got a thing or two to tell you all
This lady may have stumbled
But she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that
They can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then
God bless America again

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again (In America, did you?)
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
(We damn sure fooled you)
Yeah, we're walking real proud
And we're talking real loud again (In America)
You never did think
That it ever would happen again

From The Sound up in Long Island
Out to San Francisco Bay
And everything that's in between them is our own
And we may have done a little bit
Of fighting among ourselves
But you outside people best leave us alone
Cause we'll all stick together
And you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies
And the rebels and the yanks
You just go and lay your hand
On a Pittsburgh Steelers fan
And I think you're gonna finally understand","country, Southern Rock, classic rock, bluegrass, rock"

You ain't in
What's this cold reaction
Where you been?
Ooh baby
Layin' it on the line
If this is last call
And you say that's all you can take
It's fine
I'm sorry but
It don't make sense
You'd be a fool
If you just run out on first offense
Ooh baby play it smart
Before you go south with your big mouth
Better check your heart

Maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
I told ya
No more lying
No more tears a falling
Stop your cryin'
Ooh baby
I'm your man
Before you go back to your side track
Baby understand

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
And just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
No no no

Just my father and me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air
Hangin' still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say hold my hand
I said, love's easier when it's far away
We sat and watched the distant light
We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
There's a boat on the line
Where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I
Are like strangers, a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said, it's harder now, we're far away
We only read you when you write
We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We're just ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night","pop, easy listening, 80s, soft rock, oldies"

We put our time in 'cause we like to stay up
All night long
All night long
We keep on grinnin' 'til the weekend comes
Just a pinch between your cheek and gums

All night long
Start in the morning and get the job done
Take care of business, and we have some fun
All night long
All night long
We like a long neck and a good old song
Turn it up and then we'll sing along
Sing along
Oh, we're stayin' up all night long

We got somethin', we both know it
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret all the same
Somehow we get around it

Listen, it don't really matter to me, baby
You believe what you want to believe

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Tell me why you wanna lay there
And revel in your abandon

Honey, it don't make no difference to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No baby, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

Baby, we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned
Right now this seems real to you
But it's one of those things
You got to feel to be true

Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped
Tied up, taken away, and held for ransom

Honey, it don't really matter to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No, you don't have to live like a refugee

You don't have to live like a refugee
