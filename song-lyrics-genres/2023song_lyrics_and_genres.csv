Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me

You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I

Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage

Mate, what do you think of that girl?
The one dancing alone, I like her for myself
Beautiful, she knows she's hot
Everyone's watching her dance
I approach her and lay on the charm
We drink without reservations, just temptation
I told her, ""I'm going to win over your family, and in a few days you'll be mine""
She said I'm crazy, but she likes that
No guy acts like me

Here you go, sweetheart
And all double P, man
Just like that, my buddy Pedro

Cha-chau!

I'm not a guy with money
But when it comes to the heart, I fulfill everything for you
I held her hand tightly
My friend couldn't believe it, as I passed by
Her body, I swear to God, was so perfect
Her waist like a model's
Her eyes captivated me from the start
She liked me, and I like her",corridos tumbados; sad sierreño; corrido; sierreño; música mexicana; corridos bélicos

Karma é aquela garota, tipo (Grrah)

Você está falando merda por prazer
Viciado em traição, mas você é relevante
Você está com pavor de olhar pra baixo
Porque, se você ousar, verá a chama
De todo mundo que você queimou só pra chegar aí
Está voltando para você

E eu mantenho o meu lado da rua limpo
Você não saberia o que eu quero dizer

Porque karma é o meu namorado
Karma é um deus
Karma é a brisa no meu cabelo no fim de semana
Karma é um pensamento relaxante
Você não tem inveja que para você não é
Doce como mel? Karma é um gato
Ronronando no meu colo porque ele me ama
Flexionando como um maldito acrobata
Eu e karma vibramos assim

Karma é quando os seus cheques voltam (Caramba)
Karma é o incêndio na sua casa (Grrah)
E ela vai chegar de surpresa (Tipo)
E ela nunca vai te deixar sozinho (Caramba)
Veja ela colocar os seus inimigos no trono (Caramba)
Te fazendo balançar bandeira branca, louco pela grana
Pensando que ela vai te salvar, agora você está mudando de comportamento
Tudo bem, querido, não precisa se preocupar, o karma nunca fica preguiçoso
Então, eu mantenho minha cabeça erguida, nunca vou desistir (Nunca)
Prometo que você nunca vai ver nada menos que isso (Nunca, nunca)
Estarei balançando esse bundão, o karma é uma beleza que ganha os concursos, grrah

Porque karma é o meu namorado (Caramba)
Karma é um deus
Karma é a brisa no meu cabelo no fim de semana
Karma é um pensamento relaxante
Você não tem inveja que para você não é
Doce como mel? Karma é um gato
Ronronando no meu colo porque ele me ama
Flexionando como um maldito acrobata
Eu e karma vibramos assim (Grrah)

Me pergunte o que eu aprendi durante todos esses anos
Me pergunte o que eu ganhei com todas essas lágrimas
Me pergunte por que tantos somem, mas eu ainda estou aqui
(Eu ainda estou aqui, eu ainda estou aqui)

Porque o karma é o trovão
Chacoalhando o seu chão
Karma está no seu encalço como um caçador de recompensas
Karma vai te rastrear
Passo a passo, de cidade em cidade
Doce como a justiça, o karma é uma rainha
Karma leva todos os meus amigos ao cume (Fatos)
Karma é o cara na tela
Vindo direto para casa para mim

Porque karma é o meu namorado (Karma é o meu namorado)
Karma é um deus (Caramba)
Karma é a brisa no meu cabelo no fim de semana (Fim de semana)
Karma é um pensamento relaxante
Você não tem inveja que para você não é
Doce como mel? Karma é um gato
Ronronando no meu colo porque ele me ama
Flexionando como um maldito acrobata
Eu e karma vibramos assim

Karma é o meu namorado

Karma é meu melhor amigo (Mmm)

If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway

Somebody hand me a cigarette

Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day, but tonight I drink

You say I gotta get over you and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options and take your pick

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get

If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey, some Grizzly

Let loose, crazy, then get soaked
Get wet from my body, you know, in the Benz, get in
What's up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz
The stars on the ceiling, stellar has already left
But you know that this night you're for me
Come, climb on top of me, send me your location, I'll pick you up

She wants me to play music for her
So the baby dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yestеrday
She wants me to play music for her
So thе babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

She has not yet forgotten how we spent time
We went to the club and the two of us danced close together
Like dogs close together, kisses and a couple drinks
She stayed by my side and said, ""I think I fell in love""
She smokes, she drinks
She's a little devil, small, but spicy
I love it when she rubs it against my pants
She loves it, you can see it in her face, she enjoys it

She's got a boyfriend and doesn't behave
She tells me, ""Chill, 'cause the relationship is broken""
Our bodies crash and crash
Our mouths get together, the leggings choke her

She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday
She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

Yesterday, yesterday you were moving very well, very well
She got covered in the smell of Chanel
We're a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
She's hot and has a pretty face
You play music for her, and she gets horny by herself
For the party, she never holds back
A couple friends, she completes the crew
But you, mama, you know, I like you a lot
Crazy, come here, get close all the way back
You and me will go on a fleeting journey
Interstellar, eat you out
We will both smoke marijuana
In my room, on my rooftop and on my bed
Bae, I think you're getting a call, answer tomorrow
Don't let the fire die
On the AMG, listening to ""Ruedas y Cristal""
Burning poison that got me flying, mami
A little kiss to the Barbie, so she dances close
Slanty eyes like Puki from Taiwan, -an
Like Puki from Taiwan
Like Puki from Taiwan
I eat that pussy whenever I want, mami, mami

Let loose, crazy, then get soaked (Baby, all the way down)
Get wet from my body, you know, in the Benz, get in (Baby, all the way down)
What's up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz (Baby, all the way down)

And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

Woah

Tengo sentimientos por ti
Espero que no estés amando a los chicos
¿Cuántos cuerpos tienes?
Ruego que no sea más que unos pocos
Sé que trataste con algunos idiotas
Cuando eras joven y en la escuela
Él tuvo que reventar tu cereza
Pero lo mojé como una piscina
Ella consiguió un nuevo G-Wagon
Ella quiere ir a Highlight Room y mostrarlo
Tengo un cuerpo nuevo, chica, muéstralo
Esto es brasileño, sé que es suave
Tonificado y ella consiguió un paquete de seis
Parece que solía jugar al voleibol
American Express, puedes tenerlo todo
Código para la caja fuerte, puedes tenerlo todo
Al carajo tu página principal, ¿cuál es tu Finsta? Quiero conocer tu verdadero yo
Empezaste a bailar para pagar tu matrícula, chica, quiero saber por lo que has pasado
Quieres una botica o quieres vender cabello, solo dime en qué te gusta
Si sales en público y él quiere tu número, solo dile: ""Mi negro te hará girar""

Demonios, acabo de prender a las noticias y vi que los hombres que nunca tuvieron sexo en la escuela
Están haciendo leyes sobre lo que las mujeres pueden hacer
Tengo que protegerte, soy un hombre hecho, atado, todo el camino, nena
Así que tengo que respetarte
Los negros te pusieron las manos encima en el pasado, inseguro porque tu cuerpo es precioso
Cuatro palabras cuando pienso en ellas son: ""Crujientes, mohosas, polvorientas, oxidadas""
Ocho palabras cuando pienso en nosotros es: ""Fóllame, fóllame, fóllame, fóllame""
Te faltan el respeto y los golpearé
Los textos que envías en subtítulos
Los videos que tenemos alguna vez se filtran, nos volvemos virales o nos volvemos platino
No te preocupes por la historia de tu amiga cuando la tuve sola
Ella intentará ponerle algunos extras, te sacaré de tu zona
Ya sabes cómo es cuando no pueden conseguir una reserva en Carbone
Te dirán que es una noche fría, te dirán que prefieren quedarse en casa, sí
Putas celosas, sí
Y sé lo que dije sobre estar en Vogue
Pero al igual que ese grupo de R&B de los años 90
Chica, una llamada, te pondré en Vogue
Una llamada, tú estás en desfiles
Una llamada, estoy sentado en primera fila
Una llamada equivocada de tu ex negro diciendo estupideces que hará que lo envíen a casa
Una llamada y mis negros a diez dedos

Edepsizlik yapıyorum ve sataşıyorum, onun üstünde oturuyorum
Tüm elmaslarım onun üstüne ışıldıyor
Onunla barda buluştum, saat on iki veya öyle bir şeydi
İki şarap daha istedim çünkü bu gece onu istiyorum

Eğer umurunda olacaksa sana olaydan biraz bahsedeyim
Kendimi berbat bir durumun içinde buluyorum
Sevdiğim adam geçen gece beni karşısına oturttu
Ve bana her şeyin bittiğini söyledi, aptalca bir karar
Ve ben kalbimin nasıl parçalandığını hissetmek istemiyorum
Aslında, hissetmek istemiyorum, bu yüzden içmeye devam ediyorum
Ve ben bugün basit bir görevle şehirdeyim
Küçük siyah elbisemin içinde, üstüme de baya bir oturuyor

Sadece kalbi kırık bir kaltak, topuklu ayakkabı 15 santimetre
Gece kulübünün arkasında, şampanya yudumluyorum
Takıldığım bu kaltaklara güvenmiyorum
Taksinin arkasında kokain çekiyorum
Sarhoş aramalar, sarhoş mesajlar, sarhoş yaşlar, sarhoş seks
Benimle aynı kafada bir adam arıyordum
Şimdi başa dönüş, bara dönüş
Bentley'e, otele, eski alışkanlıklarıma

Çünkü geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Doktor, doktor, herhangi bir şey, lütfen
Doktor, doktor, bana acı
Bu acıyı al
Belirtilerimi soruyorsun, doktor, hissetmek istemiyorum

Bu esrarı içiyorum, stresimi böyle atıyorum
2019 gibi eski alışkanlıklarıma döndüm
Eski sevgilimin bitirmesinin üstünden 24 saat bile geçmedi
Üstümde yeni bir adam, biraz terlemek üzereyiz
Geçen gece çok mükâfatlıydı
Kötü günler geçirdim ve bu baya bir canımı yakıyor
Beni mazur gör, benim yatağıma girme umutların
Ne kadar yüksekse benim de kafam o kadar iyi
Bardağı yarı dolu görmek için geri adım atarsam
En azından bu iki parça Prada içinde dolaşıyorum
Ve ben çoktan pislik gibi davranıyorum, ne dediğimi anlıyor musun?
Boş boş duracağına içime sok

Sadece kalbi kırık bir kaltak, topuklu ayakkabı 15 santimetre
Gece kulübünün arkasında, şampanya yudumluyorum
Takıldığım bu kaltaklara güvenmiyorum
Taksinin arkasında kokain çekiyorum

I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am
If they see me with someone else at a disco, it's just wasting time
Baby, why would I lie to you?
If they say they saw me happy, no, no, it ain't true

Nothing makes me laugh anymore
Only when I see the pictures and videos I have of you
I went out with someone else to forget you
And I had the perfume that you like
I light up to go to sleep
Because I sleep better if I dream that you're here
If you knеw that I wrote you
I haven't sent thе messages, they're all still there
Wow, how much its cost me
Maybe I did you a favor when I left your side
Drunk looking at your pictures, it hurts me to see that you did get better
You don't have grey days, your scars don't hurt anymore
And I'm wondering if I should tell you that

I have 1% left

Drunk on your Insta, I logged in
Baby, I already know that you're doing good
That you don't want to know about me, ayy, ayy
Living in an inferno and I set myself on fire
Playing with you like I'm number ten
I feel like I'm no longer in your heart, now I'm at your feet
Begging for you, drowning myself in the tequila
The boys are asking me out
I'm having a good time, but I always end up missing you
Drowning myself in the tequila, ayy
These young women texting me, ayy
Where are we getting wasted today, but

I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am

That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, ""Climb in,"" and in she climbed
Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

I need to spin my wheels
I gotta hankerin' for four wide tires

Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leave 'em
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field home run ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone

I can say it wasn't meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind

The girl that said a void can be filled with somebody else is lying to you
It's like covering a wound with makeup, you don't see it, but you still feel it
You left, saying you were over me (Ayy) and you got a new girlfriend
What she doesn't know is you (Auh) still watch all of my stories (No, papi)

Baby, what happened? Weren't you doing well? (—ell)
Why are you looking for me? You know I don't make any mistakes twice (Ayy, papi)
Tell your new baby, that I don't compete for men
That she should stop hating, 'cause at least I kept you looking cute

Seeing you with the new one hurt (Hurt)
But I'm already ready for my own thing
I forgot everything that we lived
And that's what got you so offended
Even my life got better
You're no longer welcome here
I saw what your girlfriend said about me
I'm not even upset, I laugh, I laugh

I don't have time for whomever can't contribute, I changed directions
Making money as if it was a sport (Ah)
Filling up my account, concerts, the parking, and my passport (Ayy)
And reports are saying I look hotter (Yes)
Now you wanna come back, I can tell, mmm, yeah
Keep waiting for me, 'cause I'm an idiot (Ah)
You forgot I'm doing my thing
And that La Bichota was too good for you

Baby, what happened? (Happened) Weren't you doing well? (Ah)

More hot, more toned, more chill
Go back to you, never, you were bad luck
Because now blessings rain down on me
And you want to come back, I saw it coming
Liking my photo
You were looking for food on the outside
And I used to say it was the monotony
And now you want to come back, I saw it coming
Liking my photo (Mine)
You look happy with your new life, but
If only she knew you still look for me

Baby, what happened? (Happened), weren't you doing great? (Ah)

Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?

And the dial tone is all I have

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone

I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emеrgency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Evеn the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

I'll die

Drinks pourin', couldn't stop it
Turn another slow dance into a mosh pit
Tuck my head, then I heard the lock and
Told him that my first car was a Crown Vic
Talkin' 'bout last time I was in the back of a cop car
I fell in love
And my face on the cold window
Try to sober back up and loosen my cuffs
And it's all the same anyway

I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
""Son, are you a danger to yourself?""
Fuck that, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back

And I said I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown, ah
In the name of someone I no longer know (I no longer know)
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone

Temprano en la mañana, tarde en la noche (Esperaré por ti)

Rezas por mis demonios, chica, te tengo
Cada vez que tomo codeína, me vuelvo vulnerable
Conozco los sonidos de la tormenta cuando llega
Ella entiendе que no puedo llevarla a todas partеs, un negro va
He estado en el campo como los hijos del maíz

Puedo escuchar tus lágrimas cuando caen por el teléfono
Enojate contigo mismo porque no puedes dejarme solo
Chismes, estás desordenado, eso no es lo que estamos haciendo
Atrapado alrededor del mundo (Preocupado por un Xanny, ¿te jactarías, o te haría tratar de conseguirme?)
Por teléfono, soltando lágrimas (Dime ahora, te necesito con mucho gusto)
Tuve que volverme más vulnerable de lo que acabo de hacer (Dime ahora, te necesito tanto, sí)
Cuando estás borracha, me dices exactamente cómo te sientes (Esperaré por ti, por ti)
Cuando estoy solo lo mantengo real (Esperaré por ti, esperaré por ti)
Por favor, dile a uno real exactamente lo qué es (Esperaré, esperaré, por ti, por tí)
No lo digas porque sabes que eso es lo que quiero escuchar (Esperaré por ti)

Sí, he estado atrapado alrededor del mundo
Me siento en mi balcón y me pregunto cómo te sientes
Tengo una carrera que me quita el tiempo de las mujeres
No puedo convencerte de que te amo para vivir (Esperaré por ti, por ti)
Estaré en tu línea, los sentimientos fluyen como un río
Vuelve a enviar mensajes de texto, tú estás con tu Kiki en el río (Esperaré por ti)
Los mensajes dicen ""entregados"" (Esperaré por ti), pero sé que ustedes no lo entienden
¿Por qué nos lo presentas si sabías que estabas con él? (Esperaré por ti, por ti, por ti)
Me hizo estrechar su mano cuando estuvieron follando por un minuto (Esperaré por ti, por ti)
Sácame de la tabla porque sabes que soy nadador (Esperaré por ti)
Se suponía que era un perro, pero me pusiste en una perrera
Chica, ponle un bozal a eso, todo ese ladrido durante la cena
Te estaba follando cuando tuviste una pequeña Presidencial
Mejoró cuando me conociste y eso no es coincidencia
Traté de sacar lo mejor de ti, pero supongo que no soy tan influyente
Supongo que no soy el indicado para ti

Puedo escuchar tus lágrimas cuando caen por el teléfono

I ain't tryna fix her, I just wanna kiss her
Fuel a little fire in her soul

Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go, yeah, she knows

Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn

Backin' down the ramp in my old truck

To catch a bunch of hogs

If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book

But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up

The one that says don't cuss and don't fight

Sí
Las tensiones definitivamente están aumentando
Estoy listo ahora
H-hora
H-hora, h-hora, h-hora, h-hora

Hora del té como si tuviera una copa de esta mierda
Hora de cambiarse como golf a un cuarto de las seis
Me encanta follarme a una perra regular
Las putas famosas tontas pero ellas se quedan en mi pene
Escuché tu nuevo junte, es vergonzoso, mierda
Tú le hablas a los oficiales en alguna mierda terapista
Actúas como si amaras esta mierda Americana
Pero, realmente, la verdad es que estás asustado del 6
Sí, estás asustado del 6
Sí, estás asustado del 6
Tu guardaespaldas te puso en algún trabajo de casualidad
Ahora tu quieres ir y heredar esa mierda
No hables con el chico acerca de comparaciones, mierda
Ella pregunta por dinero por sus padre y mierda
Yo le dije: ""Yo no tengo billete""
Y ella dijo que va a esperar una pila, en una mierda Arabica
Me saqué un millón y miró a la mierda
Mi pene justo se puso duro porque un cable acaba de tocarme
Mi calendario está libre, ven a acompañarnos, de verdaf
Tío, al carajo todo el que de vueltas a la mierda narrativa
Derrito las cadenas que compré para tu jefe
Me importa un carajo todo sobre esa mierda heredica
Desde que V no está cerca, los miembros acabaron usando el Louis
Ellos ni siquiera estan vistiendo esa mierda
No hables con el chico sobre reparar alguna mierda
No hables con el chico sobre ahorrar alguna mierda
Tienes suerte de que Vogue estaba demandado
Porque yo habría estado con los Wassa en París y mierda

Y la nena es una terapeuta, desahogando sus problemas
Se acerca a mí y comienza a confesarse
Sé lo que está en juego, estoy gritando ""Liberen a Jeffrey""
Conecta llamadas de cobro directo directamente a la celda

It was right after senior year
Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was minе
Too young to know what love was
But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I don't remember where we got it from
I just remember feelin' all grown up
Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing
Never told him it was my first drink
But I told him that he was the one
You're so sure when you're that young
You think you got it all figured out
And now I laugh when I think about

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I thought that high would last forever
But that ain't what it does
Maybe we were drunk in love
Or maybe we were just

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
