Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

Because you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Ooh, a holiday

Sometimes, the system goes on the blink, and the whole thing, it turns out wrong
You might not make it back, and you know that you could be, well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So, where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves, and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, you've seen what you're like
And how does it feel? One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day (Ah, yeah, yeah)

Had a bad day (Ah, a holiday)
Had a bad day (Ah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

Lenk' ich dich ab?
Nein
Dachte ich mir

Wie geht’s dir, junge Dame?
Das Gefühl, das du gibst, macht mich wirklich verrückt
Du bist dope, lässt einen Player ersticken
Mir fehlten die Worte, als wir das erste Mal gesprochen haben
Suchst du ein Mädchen, das dich gut behandelt?
Suchst du sie tagsüber mit dem Licht?
Du könntest der Typ sein, wenn ich meine Karten richtig ausspiele
Ich werde еs bis zum Ende der Nacht herausfindеn
Du erwartest von mir, dass ich dich einfach heranlasse?
Aber wirst du mich immer noch achten, wenn du es bekommst?
Ich kann es nur versuchen, gib mir eine Chance (Chance)
Was ist das Problem? Ich sehe den Ring nicht an deiner Hand (Hand)
Ich werde der erste sein, der zugibt
Ich du machst mich neugierig, du scheinst so unschuldig zu sein
Willst du in meine Welt eintauchen?
Junge, ich bin es leid zu rennen, lass uns kurz gehen

Promiskuitives Mädchen, wo immer du bist
Ich bin ganz allein und du bist, wen ich will
Promiskuitiver Junge, du weißt schon
Dass ich ganz dir gehöre, worauf wartest du?
Promiskuitives Mädchen, du reizt mich
Du weißt, was ich will und ich habe, was du brauchst
Promiskuitiver Junge, kommen wir zum Punkt
Weil wir sind in Fahrt, bist du bereit?

Rosen sind rot, einige Diamanten sind blau
Ritterlichkeit ist tot, aber du bist trotzdem irgendwie süß
Hey, ich kann nicht aufhören an dich zu denken
Wo bist du? Stört es dich, wenn ich vorbeikomme?
Ich bin nicht von dieser Welt, komm mit mir auf meinen Planeten
Bring dich auf mein Level, glaubst du, dass du damit umgehen kannst?
Sie nennen mich Thomas, Nachname Crown
Achte die Charm, ich lege meine nieder
Ich bin ein großes Mädchen, ich kann mit mir selbst umgehen
Aber wenn ich einsam werde, brauche ich deine Hilfe
Achte auf mich, ich rede nicht für meine Gesundheit
Ich möchte dich auf meinem Team -- So wie alle anderen
Shh, Baby, wir können es niederschwellig halten (Niederschwellig)
Entspann dich, niemand muss davon wissen (Wissen)
Wenn du dabei bist, Mädchen, ich kenne einen Ort, wohin wir gehen können
Für was für ein Mädchen hältst du mich?

Promiskuitives Mädchen, wo immer du bist
Ich bin ganz allein und du bist, wen ich will
Promiskuitiver Junge, du weißt schon
Dass ich ganz dir gehöre, worauf wartest du?
Promiskuitives Mädchen, du reizt mich
Du weißt, was ich will und ich habe, was du brauchst
Promiskuitiver Junge, kommen wir zum Punkt
Weil wir sind in Fahrt, bist du bereit?

Sei nicht böse, werde nicht gemein
Werde nicht böse, sei nicht gemein
Hey, sei nicht böse, werde nicht gemein
Werde nicht böse, sei nicht gemein

Warte, ich mein's nicht böse
Ich kann dich in meinem T-Shirt sehen
Ich kann dich ohne Klamotten
Mich abtasten sehen, bevor du das machst
Das machst? -- Du solltest wissen, was ich meine
Mädchen, ich bin ein Freak, du solltest sowas nicht sagen
Ich versuche nur, in deinen Kopf zu kommen
Um zu sehen, ob du mich so bewegen kannst, wie du sagst
Alles gut, es ist in Ordnung
Ich habe etwas, das du mögen wirst
Hey, ist das die Wahrheit oder redest du Müll?
Ist deine Leistung M.V.P. wie Steve Nash?

Promiskuitives Mädchen, wo immer du bist
Ich bin ganz allein und du bist, wen ich will
Promiskuitiver Junge, ich rufe deinen Namen
Aber du machst mich verrückt, so wie du mich warten lässt

7,8,"""Ridin'""",Chamillionaire featuring Krayzie Bone,"4 ContributorsRap Critic Reviews: “Ridin’” by Chamillionaire feat. Krayzie Bone” LyricsHi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Chamillionaire. Now, back in the mid 2000's, there was a short time when Texas was all the rage in Hip-Hop. For a brief 2 or 3 years, you couldn't escape Houston rappers such as Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Lil Flip, and even old school cats like UGK started coming back on the scene. But among these emcees, few of them had as big a hit as Chamillionaire with Ridin', a forceful tune with a vibrating bass line, thumping drums, driving synths, and an unforgettable hook that brought him a number one hit on the billboard charts. Although, for a song that was such a club banger, it was actually an anthem against racial prejudice embedded in the American Police force, the likes of which we hadn't seen achieve such popularity since… well, N.W.A. For those who don't know, the phrase ""ridin' dirty"" refers to having something illegal in your car while driving, usually drugs. And in the context of the chorus...
They see me rollin, They hatin
Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
He's referring to racist cops who use their badge as an excuse to hassle people of color because they assume if they're rollin' in a nice ride, it MUST be because they're dealing drugs, and so these racist cops can't wait to reaffirm their biased views and pull over a black man with the intent of, ""put them in their place,"" as it were, that place being jail. And this is a very real problem. Seeing that black people are only about 13 percent of the American population, there is a disproportionate amount of Black people who are arrested for having marijuana in comparison to white people being arrested for having it, and if you've ever been to a predominantly white college, you know that that's not simply because white kids ""don't have as much""… So, in a slick way, this song is calling out that racial disparity, and by the sing-song nature of the chorus, it seems to take pleasure in subverting the cops' expectations
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tinted so it ain't easy to be seen
Okay, so, we start off with Chamillionaire telling us of his desire to be seen, quickly followed by him telling us that because his car's tinted, you can't really see him… okay… not the strongest way to start a song like this, but whatever…
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
AUGH!!! *calms down* Sorry, after that ""We Dem Boyz"" review, I'd just rather not hear that phrase in a rap song for a while
Next to the playstation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola, Send a jacker into a coma
Alright, here he's saying that if you try to steal his stuff, he'll… wait, wasn't this song about the police?
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Wait, is he telling all of this to the girl he's in the car with? Well, I guess telling her that he can protect himself from any carjackers probably would make her feel safe, but… maybe when talking to a lady in your car, you shouldn't immediately follow up your line about owning a gun with a line about being mentally unstable…

Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies
That's… nice… so, how about those cops?
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Okay, so finally we get to the point: police harassing him purely based on the fact that he has a nice car
Twin steady twistin like ""hit this though""
Wait, so your friend is twisting up something that he wants you to take a hit of? Oh… oh…
Police pull up from behind and is in his throat
And when the police pulled up, he swallowed this thing that he wanted you to take a hit of?
Windows down gotta stop pollution
And then, you immediately rolled down the windows, to get rid of the smell this certain thing carried with it?
CDs change, niggas like ""who is that producing?""
Hey, don't change the subject, you are ridin' dirty! Well, I guess he never explicitly said that he WASN'T ridin' dirty, he just said they're trying to catch him ridin' dirty, but to his credit, he never said he was smoking anything while driving either: he said that his friend was about to light something up, and offered it to him, but he never took it. However, of course, if the cops smelled any weed on them at all, it'd be game over for the both of them, a fate that, statistically would be 3 times less likely to happen if they were white. Now, this is a bit of a nuanced criticism I'm going with here, because I'm not saying that if a black dude should be caught doing something illegal, he shouldn't go to jail, far from it; however, I'm saying that a young black male driving a nice car should be held under the same scrutiny by police officers as if he were, say, a late 20's, early 30's upper class white guy in a nice car. By the way, thank you, music video, for that illustration. But yeah, this guy's a young, rich rapper who got where he was by being a talented artist, and if he wants to enjoy the fruits of his success, he shouldn't be profiled because of it!
Got warrants in every city except Houston

Yeah, so what he has a warrant for his arrest in*change tone* every city in American except Houston? Jeez, man! And… what are you doing in Houston that's illegal anywhere else? Well, regardless, look, I understand about racial profiling and all that, but if you've got warrant's in almost every city in America, there's no way it's racial profiling at that point. I'm pretty sure you're just kind of a criminal. Either that, or he needs to stop letting his stoner friends ride passenger. Regardless, that was not a good way to end that verse. I mean, for the most part Cham doesn't directly come off as the stereotype that the police are making him out to be, so I tried to give the guy the benefit of a doubt, but a line like that throws all of it out the window, especially at the tail end there. I don't know, maybe a guest verse from Krayzie Bone could give us a more empathetic character, a guy who's getting hassled by cops, even though he's done nothing wrong
I been drinkin and smokin holy shit cause I really can't focus
Okay… never mind that idea…
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this
Okay, so… maybe he's drinking and smoking… at the same time… but hey, he might not be hurting anybody!
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this
Big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curb and...
Oh, on the curb? So, he's driving a Huge car down a… sidewalk…. that's… bad...
Doin a hundred while I puff on the blunt
Oh, driving at 100 miles per hour onto a sidewalk… that is… not better… Yeah, there's no justification for this! You can argue about making weed legal all day, but I think you'll have far fewer supporters for driving 100 miles per hour while drunk and high. Sorry, I'm gonna have to side with the police when it comes to actions that can directly lead to...
*plays car crash at the end of the song*
...well, that. Weird that we're supposed to be rooting for Krayzie Bone in this song as the cool badass when the tail end of the song shows you the exact reason why it's illegal to be impaired behind the wheel of a car!
DAMN! I done spilled my drink…
…precisely!

Yo I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the 6 pounds and
I got heat Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me
Oh, so you're committing murder now? The hell? We don't even know why he's doing it either! There's no justification for this happening, just out of nowhere, he decides, in his intoxicated stupor, that he's going to kill someone
With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
Okay, how is this song supposed to work again? Because the way the chorus and this verse is coming together, it sounds like they're saying ""Hey! Isn't it stupid how racist cops assume black people to be criminals?"" *guncock*""Let's justify these assumptions!"" Well, maybe something else is going on! Maybe, the idea is that Krayzie Bone is the one who's REALLY the criminal, but since the cops are so busy following Chamillionaire because he has a nice ride, they're letting the REAL criminal get away! Yeah, so Krayzie Bone is committing crimes, while Chamillionaire has nothing to do with--
We bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire
Oh, so they ARE hanging out together. Well, there goes THAT theory
And they upset for sure cause they think they know
That they catchin me with plenty of the drank and dro
Well, if you're hanging out with Krayzie Bone, they will! Sorry, but Krayzie kinda ruined your vibe here. Whereas MAYBE you could excuse the last lyric in the first verse and take at face value the fact that Chamillionaire hadn't explicitly stated that he had done anything illegal, verifying the chorus as a justified chant against corruption in the American legal system, Krayzie Bone negates all of that, and makes it not about the common man mad at corruption in the police department, but about a reckless thug mad at police officers for doing their jobs, and sure, you can have a song about criminal lifestyles and all that, but the smugness and assuredness of that chorus led me to believe you guys were supposed to be the ones in the right in this scenario, being done wrong by the man, but when you're committing criminal acts, obviously out of love for being a criminal, since we have absolutely no reasonings behind your activities beyond ""wow, isn't shooting people and driving over the speed limit cool!?"" yeah, I'm sorry, but that doesn't garner as much empathy
So they get behind me tryin to check my tags, look at my rearview and they smilin
Thinkin they'll catch me on the wrong, they keep tryin
Steady denyin that it's racial profiling
You know, I'd be right there with ya on this if you hadn't mentioned the little part about having warrants in almost every city for your arrest! Call me cynical, but I highly doubt those warrants came from you running into EVERY racist cop in America. Okay, maybe I should let that line go, it was in the first verse, and from the way it was written, it might not have even been originally intended for this song. This is the third verse, and everything's completely different now… I guess…
Glove compartment gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
You know, you could see this as a bad character move on his part, but honestly, hey, he just knows the game: in the case of crooked police, it's not about justice and equality on their end, so Cham might as well play along. And actually, when you think about stuff like parking tickets, speeding tickets, and getting out of jail on bail, the only lesson to really take away from all that is, ""give us enough money, and we'll leave you alone"". So, yeah, it's messed up, but Cham is circumventing wasting time with the system by giving the man what he wants
And been a baller that I am I talk to them, giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood
Yeah, take THAT, One time! Your racial prejudice blew up right in your face, giving me a legitimate reason to not take you seriously as an officer. You're an embarrassment to the force, acting on such bigoted, baseless principles! Just… don't look over there at Krayzie Bone, just, just look at me
Well, overall, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. A LOT of this song is carried on a stellar hook and fun, bouncy production, and both emcees are quite lyrical with their delivery, by the end of the song encapsulating a lot of the distrust that black people in general have against the police. However, the constant deviations from the topic, most of which only serve to brag about getting chicks, being intoxicated and violent, ultimately fulfill the same role that racist cops look for when persecuting black people, and despite it still being drenched with tight wordplay, that fact alone throws out a lot of that goodwill. It's still a better than average song, and attempted to do more than typical mainstream rap song was doing at the time, but unfortunately, it didn't focus on delivering the topic strong enough to rate it higher
Well, I'm the Rap Critic. You don't have to like my opinion, but before you ask, of COURSE I loved the Weird Al parody. you'd have to be some kind of moron to not love Weird Al, man…","Hip-Hop, rap, Dirty South, southern rap, hip hop"

I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's comin' down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard

Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin’
What could've been
And not seein' that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ it
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart (Trade it)
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could've been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do, oh

Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

She describes the painful experience that she knows her boyfriend is going through as she is cheating on him.
Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Woah, anymore

And I don't wanna do this anymore

18 años, 18 años
Ella tiene a uno de tus hijos, te atrapó durante 18 años
Sé que alguien está pagando la manutención de los hijos de uno de sus hijos
El coche y la casa de su mamá son más grandes que ella
Lo verás en la televisión cualquier domingo
Gana el Super Bowl y conduce un Hyundai
Se suponía que iba a comprar tu pequeño Tyco con tu dinero
Ella fue al doctor, se hizo liposucción con tu dinero
Ella camina luciendo como Michael con tu dinero
Debería haberlo asegurado, Geico por tu dinero
Si no eres un punk
Mucho, ""¡Queremos prenupcial! ¡Queremos prenupcial!"" (¡Sí!)
Es algo que necesitas tener
Porque cuando te deje el culo, se irá con la mitad
18 años, 18 años
¿Y en el decimoctavo cumpleaños, descubrió que no era suyo?

(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

Ahora, no estoy diciendo que seas un cazafortunas, tienes necesidades
No quieres que un tipo fume, pero no puede comprar marihuana
Salen a comer, no puede pagar, no pueden irse
Hay platos en la parte de atrás, tiene que arremangarse
Pero mientras todos ustedes lavan, mírenlo
Él va a llegar a un Benz con ese Datsun
Tiene esa ambición, nena, mira sus ojos
Esta semana está fregando pisos, la próxima semana son las papas fritas
Así que quédate a su lado
Sé que hay tipos bailando, y sí, eso es bueno
Y seguirán llamando e intentandolo, pero tú te quedas bien, chica
Y cuando suba, te dejará el culo por una chica blanca

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

I keep my mind on my money - money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I am making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile-high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet cause you can

And switch it till you running right out of breath
And take a break until you ready again
And you can invite over as many friends as
You want to but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to hey
Luda - I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from your bottom to the top of your frame
And I - just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves and
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius
Yepp call me the renaissance man get up and
I stay harder then a cinderblock man
Hey I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I've been meaning to tell that I really must thank ya when you

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself tryin' to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot working my day around a call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But, now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine and I'm planning to keep it that way
And you can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door

Watch my life pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time, are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Yeah

'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

I've been dying inside
Little by little
Nowhere to go, but going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

And I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

Falling faster, barely breathing
Give me something to believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head
Take what's left of this man
Make me whole, once again

'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
You can have all that's left
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's left of me
Oh, oh, oh-oh

I've been dying inside, you see
I'm going out of my mind, out of my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?

He always in trouble,"" and I heard
""He's nuttin' but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club,"" and they say
""He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' them drugs,"" and I heard
""He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nuttin' but a thug""
So whaaaaaaaaat, so whaaaaaat
So whaaaaaat, so whaaaaat

And they say - I'm a slut, I'm a ho, I'm a freak
I got a different girl every day of the week
You too smart, you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm this, they say that I'm that
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact
But you don't be hearin' it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes - They're
Nuttin' but liars hatin', and I bet
They wouldn't mind tradin' pla-ces

You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Fuel to the fire, that supplies your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers
I'm that author of the book, they can judge from the cover
Yes - I, I been to jail
And yes - I'm grindin' for real
I'm a positive-talkin' negative pimp
They hate to see you doin' better than them, so!

Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space

Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside

There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat

Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck

Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah

Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's

I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no

(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me
Sexy as can be
Tonight, I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

'Cause they color coordinated, complimentin' the teeth (Alright, thanks)
So check out my swag

My money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream (Ch-ch-chain)
Give you a black eye 'cause of the beating

Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down

Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it

Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're—""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away

We did everything together
Yeah, we would wake up early in the mornin' (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need is just one wish)
Used to watch the sunrise (One wish, one wish)
Used to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish) Damn, I miss those days

If I could just have one wish

Damn, baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you—

As a matter of fact, I was the one who said I loved you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
'Cause we couldn't be alone
See, your mama knew I was somethin' else, she knew how I felt
Back then, we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up, I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missin' you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it

Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Makin' love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now, tell me, is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so, then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be lovin' me, holdin' me, kissin' me
So girl, don't tell me what I'm feelin' is make-believe
I swear, if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you, I'm sick

Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart-changin' love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes
'Cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin (Startin' here, right now)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you (Promise love), trust me, I'll trust you (I'll trust you)
If I had one wish, we would run away (Yes, we would)
Makin' love all day (It would feel so good), have us a baby (Woo)
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life (Oh, yeah)
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

And, even though we are grown, girl, I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends

Uno de mis coches, ahora voy sobre cosas buenas
Alinéalo, te garantizo que te voy a servir

Tengo a 3 o 4 chicas, pero todo ese movimiento en ese bikini me vuelve loco
Para todo el tráfico en un ""stop"" porque hablas ese idioma que hablo
Ese tempo descarado con ese andar, quizás es la razón que todas estas no me verán

Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame

Si tomas la oportunidad de que me ponga encima
Te puedo enseñar porqué lo hago bien, sobresalientes en la escuela
Soy un luchador, confia en mi y en mi edad, te tengo pensando de que soy demasiado joven para hacerlo
Puedo imaginarnos cambiando de carril en el Coupe, contigo en el teléfono gritando mi nombre, Chris

Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso

Chica, en serio, te he estado mirando, esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice
Esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice

Cariño, ¿qué tal?, intento saludarte
No estoy decepcionado, pero te cegaré si te sonrío
Estás con el joven Chris y el mejor rapero
Deja tu teléfono, trae a tus amigas, deja que lo demás pase
Un poco de Patron, Hennessy, estoy bebiendo Cavalli Vodka
Llevo tejanos y calzoncillos Cavalli, mejor que un recién nacido
Puedo trabajarte como un sofá
Puedes quedarte desnuda
Me dejo las botas y mis joyas
Nunca sé lo que quieras, voy a dejarmelo puesto
Nunca sabes quién está en casa, lo aprendí de esa canción de Biggie
A una nueva, algo como una blanca
Creo que le gusto, me tiene de tono de llamada
Y le dije, ""Ten lo tuyo y no pares""
Dame ese ritmo y lo que tienes

Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso

I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place
I was lookin' for somethin' I couldn't replace
I was runnin' away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back
On the seeds I've sown
Savin' dimes, spendin' too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright (Alright)

I went as far as I could, tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
Lived a million miles of memories on that road
Every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

Yeah

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

""Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me""

(If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me)
(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
For you

And I don't stop, I got rocks and rings, you know
The same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard

I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
And everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 'cause I know

There's never a right time to say goodbye (Yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart
And I wanna know

How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand what I'm tryna say, we just can't go on
Pretending that we get along, girl, how you not gon' see it? (Oh, oh, yeah)

Despite the nature of the song, this wasn’t… Read More 
Yeah, it's my life (Hey, Hailie)
In my own words, I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on, and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'""
""But, baby, wait!"" ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you, you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"", and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact
That your attitude excites me
(So exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex
(I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that

Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you make and get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Stupid girl (Woo), stupid girls, stupid girls

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl (Yeah), I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Uh, uh)

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Drop a name)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two and three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees

Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Maybe if I act like that (Woo), that guy will call me back (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
(Yeah) Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
(Let's break it down now)

The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take anymore
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see (Come on)

Disasters all around (Disasters all around)
A world of despair (A world of despair)
Your only concern: ""Will it fuck up my hair?""

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back (Yeah, like this, woo)
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back (Uh-huh, uh-huh, and do your thing)
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Do your thing, yeah, yeah, uh)

(Do your thing, and do your thing, do your thing, and do your thing, do your thing?)
(I like this, like this, like this)
Pretty, will you fuck me, girl? Silly, I'm so lucky, girl
Pull my hair, I'll suck it, girl, stupid girl
Pretty, will you fuck me, girl? Silly, I'm so lucky, girl
Pull my hair, I'll suck it, girl, stupid girl

They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing 'cause I don't get sleep, no

Turn forever, you and me

All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronis
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin' bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her

With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do

All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny

And now that's who I am

Of endless gratitude

But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know
I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud

Everybody needs to be loved

No more camouflage, I wanna be exposed
And not be afraid to fall
