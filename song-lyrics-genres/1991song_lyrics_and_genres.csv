I still remember just like it was yesterday

From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They are the songs of every man

God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
This is the song of every man

When it seemed the world could change at the blink of an eye
And if anything, then there's your sign

Falling in and out of love

And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed I fell into your eyes
Always thought of keeping your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder, come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?
Where do all the lonely hearts go?


Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to Summer Madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody go
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah, I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
'Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to your crib change your clothes once more
'Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends 'cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kissed
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout, it looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

The shade is on the window
And loneliness is all around

No way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling
Intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle

Then I discovered you, girl
You're like no other
Doing the time for the crime
Was I blind

Words that you were saying

Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind

That a circle can´t fit where a square should be?

There´s a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can´t be filled with the things I do

These feet of clay keep warm inside

Not fade away before I die

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love
Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Coming straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it
Let the feeling sweep you off your feet

Down in the gutter, life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade

Flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, someway
Where they're downing only deer, a hundred steel towns away

No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

Light up my darkness, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place

Drinkin' cocoa on the bear skin rug
The door bell rang, who could it be?
Thought to myself then started to shrug
Got to the door, ding dong, ""Who is it?""
My girl's best friend had paid me a visit
Sly as can be tight dress and all
She knew that I was faithful, I really didn't have the gall
I tried to chill, she made the move
Now, I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girlfriend didn't trust me, no
Yeah, but she lost control, I wouldn't take the bait
I said, ""Chill baby, baby chill baby, baby wait""

Ruin your life, sleep with your wife

Would come over late at night and say, ""Hey
I'll watch the fight"", I thought it was all right
'Cause me and Jay we were really really tight
So damned close we had the same blood type
Months went by and my wife got big
We were havin' a child and I got another gig
So I let Jay move into the crib and chill
He had his own room and helped pay the bills

It looked like Jay and I couldn't believe

At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in

To the woman who has come in

As they are kissing their hellos and
I'm pretending not to see them
And instead I pour the milk

Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope
And looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me

There's a woman on the outside
Looking inside, does she see me?
No, she does not really see me
‘Cause she sees her own reflection
And I'm trying not to notice
That she's hitching up her skirt and
While she's straightening her stockings
Her hair has gotten wet

Time, love and tenderness

So you say that you can't go on
Love left you cryin'
And you say, all your hope is gone
And what's the use in tryin'
What you need is to have some faith
Shake off those sad blues
Get yourself a new view

'Cause, some day you'll laugh at the heartache
Some day, you'll laugh at the pain
Somehow you'll get through the heartbreak
Somehow you can get through the rain

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness

I understand how you're feeling now
And what you've been through
But your world's gonna turn around
So baby, don't you be blue
All it takes is a little time
To make it better
The hurt won't last forever
Oh, all your tears are all gonna dry, you know

'Cause some day you'll laugh at the heartache
Some day you'll laugh at the pain
You may be down on your luck
But baby, that old luck's gonna change

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
On your loving

I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, it's hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey-coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me)
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay (On your loving)
Come around my way

I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me, to the bridge)
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With your New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your bikin' shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee (On your loving)
I love you, you're from around the way

I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only— You got me sh—)
I need an around the way girl (An around the way girl)
Fine as can be (On your loving), she's all I ask
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me
I need an around the way girl (An around the way—)
Fine as can be (Way)

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—

Now that we found love
What are we gonna do (Hey) with it? (Now)

One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my coin inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up, rev me up my little buttercup
We can touch cheeks snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not, here comes the brother with glow
A snugglin', bubblin' overweight lovin' hug pro
So what's it gonna be, me or the TV?
Let me take time to set your mind and your body free

Lay down your problems so I can cop a quick wreck

So spread open your love 'cause it's Heavy in the middle
Move it like a mover, she wanted to groove so I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn so we played school and I schooled her

We can toss and turn, rumble, tumble and twist
Anything you want, I'll give it fantasies we'll live it
So lay down and relax (Yeah, baby, that's it)

Spread your wings and we can fly around the world
Harmony, you're charmin' me, your fingertips are calmin' me
When you dropped the kisses, Suzie Q, you dropped the bomb on me

Every night I say a prayer
In the hopes that there's a Heaven
And every day I'm more confused
As the saints turn into sinners

All the heroes and legends
I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside
So afraid that I've lost my faith

Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Please show me the way

And as I slowly drift to sleep
For a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace
In a world so filled with hatred

Then I wake up each morning and turn on the news
To find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign
So afraid I just won't know

Show me the way, show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain
And take my confusion away
And show me the way

And if I see a light, should I believe
Tell me how will I know

Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Show me the way, show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage
To believe that I'll get there someday
And please show me the way

In the hopes that there's a Heaven","classic rock, Progressive rock, rock, hard rock, 80s"

I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong

Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do

She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure
It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all
The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste

Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help
No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help
Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help
Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

I will be there when you cry for help
Why don't I hear her cry for help?
All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help

The wind is moving
But I am standing still
A life of pages
Waiting to be filled
A heart that's hopeful
A head that's full of dreams
But this becoming
Is harder than it seems
Feels like

I'm looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

If there are millions
Down on their knees
Among the many
Can You still hear me
Hear me asking
Where do I belong?
Is there a vision
That I can call my own?
Show me

I'm looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world


Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on

Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised lands
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hands
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friends in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife, his kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried ""Forgive me for what I've done there
'Cause I never meant the things I did""

And give me somethin' to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me somethin' to believe in
Oh, Lord arise

My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile, it fades again

And give me somethin' to believe in (And give me something to believe in)
If there's a Lord above
And give me somethin' to believe in (And give me somethin' to believe in)
Oh, Lord arise

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road, you gotta take me home


I drive by the homeless sleepin' on a cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read ""Jesus Saves""
A mile away live the rich folk
And I see how they're livin' it up
While the poor, they eat from hand to mouth
The rich drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose and so few win, hah

And give me somethin' to believe in (And give me somethin' to believe in)
And give me somethin' to believe in (And give me somethin' to believe in)

I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?
Teachers told the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a Northern sun
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one
One by one

I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play

I am the one and only
Oh, yeah

Call me, call me by my name
Or call me by my number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it
And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am, don't tell me I know best
I'm not the same as all the rest

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I've been a player in the crowd scene
A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and aspirations
Ideas above my station, maybe
But all this time I've tried
To walk with dignity and pride

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I can't wear this uniform without some compromises
Because you'll find out that we come
In different shapes and sizes
No one can be myself like I can
For this job, I'm the best man
And while this may be true
You are the one and only you

I am the one and only

Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)

A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

I won't let you down
So please don't give me up

Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face

Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV

Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me

Every time we kiss, I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me

And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

Every day I wake up, I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to which so many people never find the key
And if the sun should ever fail to send its light
We would burn a thousand candles
And make everything all right

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door

My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
And I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

I'm not sure that I'll be fine
I never thought it would end this way

When I opened up the door
I saw red

And I didn't need to see his face
