Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothin', I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lyin' to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, ""I only think of you""
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart

I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gon' talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)

Ella toma mi dinero cuando estoy en necesidad
Sí, ella es una trivial amiga de hecho
Oh, ella es una cazafortunas
Que camina sobre la ciudad que cava en mí
(Uh)

(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

Cutie la bomba, la conocí en un salón de belleza
Con un pequeño Louis Vuitton debajo del brazo
Ella dijo: ""Puedo decirte roca, puedo decirlo por tu encanto
Tan lejos como chicas, tienes un rebaño
Puedo decirlo por tu encanto y tu brazo""
Pero estoy buscando a la elegida, ¿La has visto?
Mi psíquica me dijo que tendría un culo como el de Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez; cuatro hijos
¿Y tengo que llevarme todos esos traseros malos a ShowBiz?
Okay, busca a tus hijos, pero luego ellos tienen a sus amigos
Paré en el Benz, todos se levantaron
Todos fuimos a cenar y luego tuve que pagar
Si estás follando con esta chica, será mejor que te paguen
¿Sabes por qué? Se necesita demasiado para tocarla
Por lo que escuché, ella consiguió un bebé de Busta
Mi mejor amiga dijo que solía follar con Usher
No me importa lo que ninguno de ustedes diga, todavía la amo

(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante

18 años, 18 años
Ella tiene a uno de tus hijos, te atrapó durante 18 años
Sé que alguien está pagando la manutención de los hijos de uno de sus hijos
El coche y la casa de su mamá son más grandes que ella
Lo verás en la televisión cualquier domingo
Gana el Super Bowl y conduce un Hyundai
Se suponía que iba a comprar tu pequeño Tyco con tu dinero
Ella fue al doctor, se hizo liposucción con tu dinero
Ella camina luciendo como Michael con tu dinero
Debería haberlo asegurado, Geico por tu dinero
Si no eres un punk
Mucho, ""¡Queremos prenupcial! ¡Queremos prenupcial!"" (¡Sí!)
Es algo que necesitas tener
Porque cuando te deje el culo, se irá con la mitad
18 años, 18 años
¿Y en el decimoctavo cumpleaños, descubrió que no era suyo?

(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas
(Cuando lo necesito) Pero ella no se mete con negros pobres
(Ella me dio dinero) Ahora, no digo que sea una cazafortunas

Ahora, no estoy diciendo que seas un cazafortunas, tienes necesidades
No quieres que un tipo fume, pero no puede comprar marihuana
Salen a comer, no puede pagar, no pueden irse
Hay platos en la parte de atrás, tiene que arremangarse
Pero mientras todos ustedes lavan, mírenlo
Él va a llegar a un Benz con ese Datsun
Tiene esa ambición, nena, mira sus ojos
Esta semana está fregando pisos, la próxima semana son las papas fritas
Así que quédate a su lado
Sé que hay tipos bailando, y sí, eso es bueno
Y seguirán llamando e intentandolo, pero tú te quedas bien, chica
Y cuando suba, te dejará el culo por una chica blanca

(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate
(Tengo que irme) Bájate chica, adelante, bájate

Йеа, ага
Так соблазнительно

Возьму тебя в магазин сластей
Дам полизать тебе там леденец
Давай, детка, не тормози
Не прекращай, пока не удовлетворишь меня, во-оу
Возьму тебя в магазин сластей (Йеа)
Попробуешь то, что у меня есть? (Ага)
Заставлю тебя потратить весь кэш (Давай)
Не прекращай, пока не удовлетворишь меня, во-оу

Можешь выбрать любую позу, какую захочешь
Ты можешь сделать всё сама, а можешь и просто расслабиться
Температура повышается, окей, переходим на следующий уровень
На танцполе полно народу, прям не протолкнуться
Но ради тебя, детка, я остановлю всю движуху
Если ты будешь нимфоманкой, то и я стану нимфоманом
В отеле или на заднем сиденье тачки, что возьмём напрокат
На пляже или в парке — в любом месте, какое ты выберешь
У меня есть волшебная палочка. Я доктор, и я выписываю вам дозу любви
Твои друзья дразнят тебя, ведь ты влюбилась в меня по уши
Хочешь показать мне, как умеешь двигаться, детка? Нет проблем
Забирайся ко мне и работай бёдрами, прыгай вверх-вниз, как лоурайдер
Когда становится жарко, я словно среди сучек, что текут по весне
Заставлю тебя работать, пока не вспотеешь, и только тогда дам поиграться с волшебной палочкой
Детка, пойми меня, я намекаю тебе, как только могу
Я растаю не в твоих руках, а только у тебя во рту (Ха-ха)

Возьму тебя в магазин сластей
Дам полизать тебе там леденец
Давай, детка, не тормози
Не прекращай, пока не удовлетворишь меня, во-оу
Возьму тебя в магазин сластей
Попробуешь то, что у меня есть?
Заставлю тебя потратить весь кэш
Не прекращай, пока не удовлетворишь меня, во-оу

Детка, то, что мы делаем (Что мы делаем)
И где мы это делаем (И где мы это делаем)
То, чем мы занимаемся (То, чем мы занимаемся)
Всё это только между тобой и мной, йеа (Оу йеа)

Отдайся мне, детка, мы сделаем всё медленно и аккуратно
Забирайся наверх и представь, что ты попала на родео
Кажется, ты никогда не слышала подобных звуков
Всё потому, что я никогда не испытывал ничего подобного
И каждый раз, как только я вхожу в дверь
Она тянется к моей ширинке, чтобы её расстегнуть
Мы словно на каких-то гонках — кто разденется быстрее
Чёрт, в стрингах она выглядит так эротично, что даже как-то иронично
То, что я вижу её задницу перед собой, даже когда уйду домой
Я дотрагиваюсь до правильного места в правильное время
Хоть включён свет, хоть выключен, она всегда любит, когда я сзади
Это так привлекательно, вы бы видели, как она двигается
Своими бёдрами, когда мы делаем это на полу
И пока она не остановится, не остановлюсь и я
Вспотели насквозь, но мы не прекращаем это делать
Одновременно с этим пьём шампанское, бутылка за бутылкой
И мы не остановимся, пока не выпьем всё до последней капли

Возьму тебя в магазин сластей
Дам полизать тебе там леденец
Давай, детка, не тормози
Не прекращай, пока не удовлетворишь меня, во-оу
Возьму тебя в магазин сластей
Попробуешь то, что у меня есть?
Заставлю тебя потратить весь кэш
Не прекращай, пока не удовлетворишь меня, во-оу
Возьму тебя в магазин сластей

Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside

Go, go, go, 50 in the house, bounce
Y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sound sick over Dre drums, nigga
I ain't stupid, I say Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves is so erotic
I watch her, I'm like, ""Bounce that ass, girl""
I get it crump in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here, we'll thump in here, oh!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club with the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh (one, two, three, let’s go!)

Sip champagne and burn a little greenery

Disco inferno, let's go
You're now rocking with a pro

Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie, I don't dance, all I do is this
It's the same two-step wit a lil twist
Listen, pimpin', I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention, boy, I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Cris' with a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we finna carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon' be up in this bitch till we break daylight (daylight) (one, two, three, let’s go!)

Homie, you can catch me swooping
Bentley coupin' switching lanes, haha
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah

I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G-Unit
Next level now, turn it up a notch

I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ahh)

I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say, I'm no good, 'cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash

Homie, it's Game time
You ready? Here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker crunk
It took two months but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, ""Huh?""
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head lumped
50 got a gun
Ready? Here it come

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean (Oh my god, do you see them?)
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king

No, I don't, I'm just a no-class beat-down fool
And I will always be that way (Yes, you will)

Now it seems to me that you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else?
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way?
Show me how you feel
More than ever, baby

But I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this (Whoa)
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

(Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)
(Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)

Now it's hard for me when my heart's still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me, and it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything, just to get you back again
Why can't we just try?

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this (Whoa)
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this (Whoa)

I don't wanna be lonely anymore

What if you were good to me?
What if I could hold you 'til I feel you move inside me?
And what if it was paradise? (Paradise)
And what if we were symphonies?
What if I gave my all my life to find some way to stand beside you?

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this (Whoa)
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
But you know I could never stand for this (Whoa)
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure

See these ice cubes? (Uh) See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat

I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, prob'ly out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs, I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!)

On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meanin' of a ghostwriter
Ten G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call I'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have fifty cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on, see how time fly?

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop

And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win, this is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin' on Sha Money to land, sittin' in the Range
Thinking how they spent thirty million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's goin' on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Far away (I will)
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Turn around, now switch, uh

Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
(Hey)
Something sexy 'bout a
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick-on-chick or something
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell, ""Stop that""
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it 'round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now, switch

He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody""?
But, oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin' ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin, baby, come on

See if you could do that switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth, fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one, too and

And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

Now, I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen them all but ain't none of them at all (Like you)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (Like you)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl, then she gotta be just (Like you)
And baby, that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we, first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kinda guy to try to dog you out, but
I ain't that kinda guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned to my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady cause baby, you know

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

And every time I think about you
When you ride, when you call, when you come ('Round)
Your love is amazing to me
I can't wait 'til I see you - I wanna be with you again
And every time you're out on the road (I'll make a trip)
And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)
That I'm your main chick who got that game chick
One and the same chick - the one you can hang with

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

Okay, when you hit the mall, pop tags spend a few G's
Hit the runway to a new season
It ain't nothin', I spoil the one I care for
Feel like I ain't doin' enough, that's when I shared more
I give you dis, give you dat, what you need, love?
You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job, but I do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get wit you when I can, so that's how I let you know
And you be trippin' 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holla to right after my shows
And I was trippin' in a sense, I was tense
But my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together, say whatever
But since I met you, my life seem so better

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me

I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just want to be alone
I'm pissed 'cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause I've channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is:

I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
Tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you goin' down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
And I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I’m drunk and I’m feeling down
And I just want to be alone
You should've never come around
Why don’t you just go home?
'Cause you’re drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn’t understand
(But you didn’t understand)
Go fix yourself!

I can't help you fix yourself

So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free

A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing 'cause I don't get sleep, no

One more kiss could be the best thing

And you're not something I deserve

In my head, there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world, there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin' through

In my head, there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world, there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Just let me go
Let me go

And no matter how hard I try
I can't escape these things inside I know
I know
When all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows
Who knows

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up

The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do

I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends


Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends","punk rock, rock, punk, pop punk, alternative"

You know how we do
It's another one

I saw you walking down on Melrose
You looked like an angel straight out of Heaven, girl
I was blown away by your sexiness
Now all I have to do is catch up to you

Slow down
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

A butterfly tattoo right above your navel
Your belly button's pierced too, just like I like it, girl
Come take a walk with me, you'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you, it's so thorough and real, yeah

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, hope you're ready
I'm in awe 'cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (Enjoy you)
Let's kick it, girl

How long before you decide?

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, Mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad (Haha)","rap, Hip-Hop, hip hop, Eminem, pop"

Ay payita mía, guárdate la poesía
Guárdate la alegria pa' ti
Y oye, dámelo

No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Y tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos y hablando de ella

Ay, amor, me duele tanto (Me duele tanto)
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso y nos decimos adiós

Que esto es una vez, es otra vez
Que esto es una vez, es otra vez

No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas

Ay, amor, me duele tanto, me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay amor, es una tortura perderte

Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor

Oye negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mí que es mejor
Oye mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera, sin ti no tengo paz
Yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
Y como el ave que vuelve a su nido

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Y es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

T-I-P, coming live from the V.I.P
Heard the nightlife lost life without me
Both the feds and the state wanna see bout me
The whole city got biz-zerk, he got three
That other nigga got a hit, but shawty, he not me (Naw)
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The King back now, hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers getting naked 'fore I sat down
Still balling, money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road, doing shows, putting my mack down
Mississippi to Philly, Albuquerque to Chatt-Town

I got the crowd yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, from the back, they yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

Once again, what other rap nigga hood-er than this?
I got rich, and I'm still on some hooligan shit
You be rapping 'bout blow, I was moving the shit
You talking 'bout shooting out, and I was doing the shit
If I hit you in the face, you gon' be suing and shit
And if I catch another case I know I'll truly be missed, so I'ma
Keep a cool head, stay out of the news headline
And show these other rappers it's bedtime (Bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed-out, hard-top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit, 'cause I get better with time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine?

I got a packed house yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all my hot girls yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Ayy, all the dope boys yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

Uh-y-yeah! Mic check, one-two, one-two
You wanna beef with the King? What is you' gon do?
Will you show up on the scene with two guns drew?
Or you and your friend and play a little two-on-two?
If you knew half of what I knew, then you'd be hitting the deck
I got a tool and a vest—I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Show thim this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp, my nuts too large, and we way too fresh
Work well with nines, AK's, and Tecs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You wanna beef, nigga? Bring your best

'Cause we be standing in your front yard yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard

Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face from a chapter in my past
Talked for a while, asked him how it's been
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last, showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, shared some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye, and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you

Now the truth is it hurts, but I know that the fault is mine
‘Cuz I let him go
Tried to get over it, but it's messin' with my mind
(Because I know)

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is) I never got over you

I got new shoes on my ride (Uh, yes, sir)
Rollin' down 95 (Uh, yeah, yes, sir)
And you can see in my eyes (Yes, sir)
That I'm lookin' for a cutie pie (Yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (Yes, sir)

I don't know why, but the ladies call me Baby Blue then stick 'em
They take me and rape me and make me their victim
I lick 'em and freak 'em, if they married, I sneak 'em
If they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stunnin' through the city tryna find a lady who's
Beautiful but she gotta have booty too
Baby Blue gon' let you do what you wanna do
You could feel on it if you really want to, ah-hoo-ah
Get a taste of this salami
Knock, knock, knock, knock you down like a tsunami, bustin' you like a tommy

Spectac' with the bad chick in the back
Tryna beat it up like a Everlast punchin' bag
Hotter than a Bisquick biscuit out the oven
Your baby mama go on missions to get this lovin'
We kissin' and huggin', she never pick the phone up
You be lookin' for her while we be doing the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms
But she loves when she get the back-to-back orgasms
Yes, sir, the game is automatic
Give it to them one time and they come back like addicts

Let me drop my top, pull up in the parkin' lot
Grab a grape soda, bag of chips (That's all I got)
Park outside rims minglin' with my homeboys
Fake dap, fake hugs, leave me 'lone, boy
Plus the Caddy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls actin' 'cross the street
But on the other hand, Alfalfa just hit me on my metro cell
Party in the Ball Hog, baby, let's go

It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I've found the love of my life
Passes, things get more comfortable

And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool

And we used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

Remember Harbor Boulevard?
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed, but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

Trust me man, it's okay, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, ""Oh no""
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'ma tell you what Em told me, homie
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's fo sho
I got the info you already know
Man, I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go

What it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now, shorty, let's get into it

Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homie, let's get into it

You wanna search me, then search me, but hurry up, 'cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink 'til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make 'em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit, these tricks'll frame ya (Word)
But, in any event, keep fuckin' with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holla
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club, feed them liquor otherwise we starve 'em
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

The song won the 2004 Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the 47th Grammy Awards
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters, too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters, too

Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters, too

So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too","singer-songwriter, acoustic, rock, pop, Acoustic Rock"

She said, ""I've seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""

I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""

I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was","country, toby keith, male country, contemporary country, pop"

Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Move so fast, baby, now I can't find you

All that talk, but it seems like you can't come through

Is a partner that meets me only halfway and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Do you understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you?

Didn't mama teach you to give affection?

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're past the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you've made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion, y'all
It gets more confusin' every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walkin' away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow, we'll never know

She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doin'
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

She can't keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on one-hundred proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me
The more I adore her
What can I do?
I'd do anything for her

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

And when she sees it's me
On her caller ID
She won't pick up the phone
She'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
'Cause every word she's ever said
Is still ringin' in my head
Still ringin' in my head
She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doin'
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

But I keep comin' back for more

She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
Oh, I keep comin' back for more

Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me

I remember back then, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin' me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin' pens, workin' my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out more than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with four or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin' baller, she would
Want a nigga now, but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryna call me
Bitch I'ma dog your ho-ass like you dogged me
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nothin' changed but my change, I'ma stay the same
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know my name

Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me, I said

Before my paper came, before I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin' on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name started blowin' up quick, now they jumpin' on my dick
'Cause they see me on the rise, and know now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin' up quick, now they jumpin' on my dick

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
What the hell are you waiting for?
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearing the 4-5
It ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowing you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, till your lungs get sore

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me, with someone disappointed in you
Can I get an encore, do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time, people make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time, I need y'all to roar","Hip-Hop, rap, rock, alternative, hip hop"

Oh chariot, your golden waves

Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
If it's a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and

Flows poison like Ivy—oh, they grimy!
Already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
Respected highly; Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!
Hope all is well—kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now, the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
