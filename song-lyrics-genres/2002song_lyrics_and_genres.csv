Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, ""Are we havin' fun yet?""

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said, ""I love you,"" and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you

But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why you're treating me so bad (Treat me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me and I was all you had (All you had)
And though my heart is beating for you, I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay

See, my days are cold without you (Without you)

Baby, I don't know why you wanna do me wrong (Do me wrong)
See, when I'm home, I'm all alone and you are always gone (Always gone)
And boy, you know I really love you, I can't deny
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears after all these years

See, my days are cold without you (My days, yeah)

And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you (I keep on running back to you)
Ooh, I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad what love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
So all of my ladies (Ladies)
Feel me, come on, sing with me

See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same
That you ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)

See, my days are cold without you (My days are cold, baby)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more (No more, no more)

But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more (No more, no more)
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me, leave me and desert me?
Boy, I gave you all my heart and all you did was tear it up
Looking out my window, knowing that I should go

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go","rock, alternative rock, pop rock, alternative, pop"

It starts with one

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

7,8,"""What's Luv?""",Fat Joe featuring Ashanti,"3 ContributorsRap Critic Reviews: “What’s Luv” by Fat Joe feat. Ashanti LyricsHi, I'm the Rap Critic! Let's talk about Fat Joe… technically for the first time, since, ""Lean Back"" was by Terror Squad, even though he just happened to be rapping on about 77% of it. Now, I want to correct a little mistake I made in that episode, because I had said that it was Big Pun who was the leader of the Terror Squad and that when he died, the head of the group changed over to Fat Joe, but in actuality, it was Fat Joe that founded Terror Squad, and then Big Pun joined them later. Which is weird to me, because, I mean, Big Pun is, like, Mr:
""Rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity filling""
I mean, he always came off as the guy in charge, and Fat Joe, *sample lyric from Twins* I mean, he's not bad, I don't want you to think that he sucks, but… he's… when your standing next to:
""A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support""
You're gonna look like second in command, whoever you are. And in addition, it was kinda Big Pun who became more popular than him in such a short amount of time, with hits like ""Still Not a Player"" charting around 98, and Fat Joe not really having a big hit until 2002 with this song ""What's Luv"", and guess what? Both of them were ""Thugs Need Love Too"", songs. Although like I've always said, you can talk about anything as long as you make it interesting, and with Pun, he had the asshole rap personality down pat. You see, the man was so brash and upfront with his delivery, it was kind of endearing:
""Bet Ya Man Can't do it like this
He can't work the middle, cause his thang too little""
""I don't wanna be a player no more
(I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot)""
And that's what made him likable: the over-the-topness of his lyricism made him enjoyable to listen to, as well as having outstanding rhyming abilities, and in addition, Pun was just more fun. I mean, for a guy who looked like this… he knew that he had to do something to compensate for his appearance, and so when making a love… okay, it's just a sex song, there's nothing lovey dove about this:
""I rip my prick through ya hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers""
But, when making this kind of song, he always came off as a guy who did not take himself too seriously
""Litte brown hairs everywhere""

However, with Fat Joe… well, like I said, he's not bad, he just came off like he was trying to fit in with the crowd and not stand out at all. I mean, for God's sake, he had Ashanti singing the chorus, who was, at the time, the go to ""Thugs need love"" singer for Ja Rule's songs. In fact…
What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Y'All}
What's love?
Is that Ja Rule on the chorus with Ashanti? Well, he's not in the video, but that's obviously his voice. Jeez, Fat Joe, were you just trying to trick people into thinking this was a Ja Rule song? I mean, he doesn't have a verse anywhere in here, so what other purpose was he here for? Or maybe, his presence was so ubiquitous around this time, the very essence of Ja Rule just started spilling into other ""Thugs need Love too"" songs
*singing*: what's love… *Ja: Got to do… go to do with it, babe*
*look confused* (Just … keep singing) Wha… what's love … *Ja: it should be about us….*
Okay, we've wasted enough time, is this song by itself any good? Well, let's start off by actually looking at that chorus
What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Uh}
Okay, so this is an obvious homage to the Tina Turner Song ""What's Love Got to Do with It""
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

Oh what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
And this song is about a woman trying to protect her feelings by devaluing the idea of love as nothing more than a chemical reaction to an arousing stimuli so that she can convince herself that it's meaningless. It's about someone who doesn't want to be hurt again, and it uses the verses to build up to the theme of the chorus. Okay… so what's THIS song about

What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Uh}
So, they just start the song with ""What's Love Got to Do with it""… with what? What's love got to do with what? What are you referring to when you say ""it""? What, was there something in the intro I missed? What did they say there?
""Irv Gotti!""
What's love got to do with Irv Gotti? The point I'm trying to make is, when you have a phrase like, ""What's Love Got to do with it?"", you need to have a lyric that it has something to do with first. I know what you're referring to, but you haven't told me why you're referring to it. It just feels like, ""Hey, you know this song exists, so we're referencing it!"" And that's not even in Rap Music, that's English! A pronoun like ""it"", refers to a noun, something you did not give me! But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe they explain
What's love? It should be about us, it should be about trust babe
Okay, so now we're given a little context! She's saying that love SHOULD be about them being together, and it SHOULD be about trust. Okay, so from that, I can assume that the singer and rapper are in a relationship, and things aren't going so well in that relationship. Well, let's see how the rapper, Fat Joe responds to what she says
Yeah, slow down baby
Let you know from the gate I don't go down lady
*long pause*… well--*cut*
Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye
But you talk to much man your ruinin' my high
…Well--*cut*
You say you gotta man & your in love
Okay, BACK UP a minute! Let me try to figure this out. So, the chorus is all about how Love is supposed to be about trust and being together. I got that. And then, the first thing you thought to say to jump off from that is...

Yeah, slow down baby
Let you know from the gate I don't go down lady
So, this is kinda the conversation I'm picturing here:
Girl: Hey, babe, I love you, but I just want to make sure that our relationship is based on us trusting eachother
Guy: I don't do oral sex
Girl:… okay, I don't think that directly relates to what I was talking about…
Guy: …you can… ""Trust"" that I'll never do oral sex?
Girl: This isn't gonna work out…
And NEXT, you say
Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye
But you talk to much man your ruinin' my high
Which is not exactly the most romantic follow-up to telling a girl you won't go down on her
You say you gotta man and you're in love
Wha, wait a minute, wait a minute… YOU'RE not her boyfriend? Well, who the hell are you? Wait, are you the person that she's cheating on her boyfriend with? I guess that gives the chorus better context, because now it's like she's saying ""I'm cheating on my boyfriend purely because I want to have sex with you, so what does love have to do with what we're doing?"" My question is, ""who said it did?"" If you're obviously only having a one night stand with this guy, and you have a freaking boyfriend back home, I'm pretty sure no one's under the assumption that love has anything to do with this, so why did YOU bring it up? That's liking asking ""What do cleaning products have to do with fishing""? Well, nothing, they're not even close to the same category, but now that you brought it up, I think that there must be something there. With this song, if you listen to any of the lyrics, it's obvious that it's not about being in love, it's about sex, but it feels like they threw the word love in there to make people think it's a love song. You see, this is why I hate these ""Thugs need love too"" songs. There's always this air of deception. Like, ""oh we said love a lot in the chorus, but naw, I'm not REALLY trying to get in a relationship"". Dude, just SAY that you want a one night stand. I guarantee you that your groupies are gonna be down for it. You don't need to lie to them
You say you gotta man and you're in love
But what's love gotta do with a little menage
Nothing. Love has nothing inherently to do with a three way. However, if you wanted to, you could go into how one of you may be confusing love for sex, or that someone is conflicted about how they feel about the other, but you never do that. Both of you seem pretty comfortable with what's going on. There's no ambiguity about what's happening here. There shouldn't be this many questions floating around
Me & you
Could just slide for a few
& she could come too
That's love!
That's love? But wait, I thought it was clear that there was no love involved with in this situation! Why does that change now that this third girl is involved. What, do you love her? I don't… ah, whatever...
Mommy, I know you got issues
You gotta man
But you need to understand
That you got something with you
Hold on, is he telling her to go back to her boyfriend? Because it sounds like he's saying, ""Hey girl, you've got a man, but you need to understand that you've got something there. You've got love, and a caring relationship, even though it's not perfect. Well, that'd be interesting… judging from the rest of the song, though, that's probably not what he means, but that last line is so vague, I have no idea what he's talking about. She's got something with her? What, a meatball sub that she didn't finish, i mean,  he is FAT Joe, so, okay, that can't be it, maybe he's just using a vague phrase to talk about how hot she is?
Ass is fat, frame is little
Thought so
Tattoo in your chest with his name in the middle
…Why would you bring that up? Do you, like, get a kick out of knowing the name of the person she's cheating on?
I'm not a hater I just crush a lot
Oh okay, he's not being malicious, like, he doesn't hate the guy who this girl is cheating on, he just really likes sex. Although, I think it's funny that he uses the edited version of the phrase from the Big Pun song ""Still Not a Playa"", because in both cases, I'm pretty sure the edit was intended to mean that he gets easily smitten with a lot of chicks, and you know, develops a crush on them. However, when I first heard the edited version, well, I'll just say that the verb ""crushing"" doesn't exactly lend itself to a positive image when describing the sexual exploits of overweight men. I hope the women were always on top, is what I'm trying to say
Not my fault cause they love the kid
Maybe the chain or the whip
I don't know what it is
You. you don't know what it is? You just, can't figure out why women would possibly be attracted to a popular rapper who brags about popping bottles and driving fancy cars, and your deductive reasoning led you to believe these women were purely attracted to your necklace? Well, gee, Fat Joe, I hate to burst your bubble, but these girls were only attracted to your winning personality. Women just can't get enough of the fact that you tell them they talk too much, and they swoon and sigh over your complete refusal to reciprocate oral sex
You came here with the heart to cheat
So you need to sing the song with me
Yep, you already made the choice to ruin the trust in your relationship. Don't be shy now just because he made a song about it
When I look in your eyes there's no stoppin' me
I want the Don Joey Crack on top of me
She wants that Don Joey Crack on top of her? Like, Fat Joe's butt? I… I didn't know you were into that, Ashanti. No wait, I'm sorry, apparently, one of Fat Joe's aliases is Joey Crack, which I'm guessing was his drug dealing name. Wait, no, No, that doesn't make any sense, since Drug dealers usually use code names that DON'T directly allude to drugs. No respectable drug kingpin would name himself, ""Mikey the illegal drug dealer"". It kinda ruins the point of having a code name. So, no, I'm not convinced: this line is totally about Fat Joe sitting on Ashanti
Don't want your stacks (Yeah)
Just break my back
You know, I don't think her light, airy singing voice is matching the topic she's talking about. Like, she's singing as if she's talking about something innocent, like ""I don't want your cash, just hold my hand!"" when she's actually singing something along the lines of, ""I don't want any money, just rupture my spinal cord"". But hey, maybe she's into that sort of thing. Maybe she just really likes having her body squashed by obese men. I mean, really, listen to this again, and imagine a fat guy across the room about to bellyflop Ashanti
""Come on… and put it oooon me…. on me…""
*imitating Ashanti's portly lover*: ""I'mma put it on ya, girl!""
Okay, that's enough of that. Overall, I'd give this song a 2.5 out of 5. The beat's fun, and admittedly, the chorus is enjoyable enough to sing along to, but it all falls apart as soon as you start to look into the construction of the lyrics. Fat Joe, while not terrible, seems to just lack the energy and personality it takes to make this type of song forgivable, so I'm just left with yet another bland character who has sex with someone else's girlfriend, and when you don't do or say anything to liven it up, fellas, it gets kinda old. Well, I'm the Rap Critic, I analyze the lyrics, because no one else does *comes towards the camera*","Hip-Hop, rap, east coast rap, hip hop, Gangsta Rap"

Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh, yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh, you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies, say, ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, ha, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track (Yeah)
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house (Oh, you're stuck)
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about (Look at yourself)
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else (Somebody)
You got it bad


You got it, you got it bad

Feels like forever
Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me

Oh, how quickly life can turn around

It feels so good to reunite

But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)

Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be okay (I need to be okay)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be living without you (Living without you, shit 'cause life is crazy)
So now it's time for me to make that move (Uh, check it)

Yo, nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin (Oh, no)
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright (Be alright, yes)
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right? (Oh, no)
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat (Said I'm gonna be alright)
I'm slow caught

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it

Takin' it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag, watchin' all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words (Hey baby)

Watchin' boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom

Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance
From his body, so buttery brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook, I had to catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride
Let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left; a reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was looking so good, I couldn't reject myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was feeling so good, I had to touch myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was eyeing my thighs, butter pecan brown
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, comin' outta my shirt and then my skirt came down

You off the planet, wherever you at you stand out
Plus you specialize in freakin your man out
Put it all in one put lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She feenin till I'm in her arms, I'm King (?)
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandelous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic
Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

He breaks, me down, he builds, me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes, in late, but it's, okay
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his team, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

Thinkin of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'ma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted

I want to scream at the top of my lungs

So the good boys and girls take the so-called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and maybe transfers
They read all the books, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines

I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you

But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
'Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you

But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?

See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong

But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!

Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!

Now I'm all confused 'cause for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back

And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Can't get you out of my system)

'Cause when we kissed, the moment after, I looked at you different, yeah
Lately, I gotta watch what I say
'Cause you take things personal nowadays

Killin one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table

Dances around, she struts with the ""fuck"" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk

But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride (Ho-ho-hood rich)

And tell momma get a mink, baby girl let's ride (That's right)
You a number one stunna and we gon' glide
And go straight to the mall and tear down the inside

Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-wagon is so fly

Turn around and sit it down and let 'em bite your butt

Cruisin' through the parkin' lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me 'cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (Skrtt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, (Uh uh) boy can you top that
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button
The trunk went ""uh-uh"", and all of a sudden
Four 15's, didn't see no wires
And then I heard (Boom) from the amplifiers

Six bad broads flyin' in at nine

New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly

And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop

Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, ""Love to rendezvous""
She asked me, ""What we were gonna do?""
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine

She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I, oh-oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh, yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (Ooh, yeah)

From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that

Is just call me, call me

Get the fuck back, guard your grill
There's something wrong, we can't stay still
I've been drinking and busting too
And I been thinking of busting you
Upside your motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in (Aw, girl), they'll be more dead
Causin' confusion, disturbin' the peace
It's not an illusion, we runnin' the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? (No, nigga)
I'm doing a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck out of my way
I'm DUI, hardly ever caught sober
And you about to get ran the fuck over

Here I come, here I go, uh-oh, don't jump, bitch, move
You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd? Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down, I fuck the crowd up, that's what I do
Young and successful, a sex symbol, now bitches want me to fuck 'em, true, true
Hold up, wait up, shorty, oh, oh, what's up? Getting my dick sucked, what are you doing?
Besides minding my fuckin' business, trying to get my paper, child support suing
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fucking TVs and the jewelry? Bitch, tell me that
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'ma tell you like this, bitch, you better not walk in front of my tour bus

Beef, got the right mack
Hit the trunk, grab the pump, punk, I'll be right back
We buying bars out, showing scars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Call up Tit, grab the pills 'cause we poppin' tonight
Beat the shit outta security for stoppin' the fight
I got a fifth of the Remy, fuck that Belve' and Cris'
I'm selling shit up in the club like I work in that bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas
We on the dance floor, throwing 'bows, beating up niggas
I'm from the Dec', try to disrespect DTP
And watch the bottles start flying from the VIP
Fuck this rap shit, we clap, bitch, two in your body
Grab your four, start a fight, dog, ruin the party
So move, bitch, get out the way, ho

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not

But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

You know it's true, oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling


Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

If I could choose a place to go, it gotta be far away
From here, we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And if I can go with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin' like leavin' the coast too
Feelin' like leavin' with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin' the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade

And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways?

Employed with the block since around '94, boy
And if I could flow with you

I'll send Dutch and three other goons to go get you

Babe, take me with you, 'cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me (Yo, uh)

So now that we got a plan are you comin'? We could plan a week (Come on)
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?
And a seat, no aisle, the window, 'cause I like to see (Okay)
And seein' as to how I'm so fly, me and the clouds can speak
And since we 'bout to go in a few, go 'head
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off, I'm grateful, what was you tryin' to say, boo?
Nothin', just grab my chain off the table and two-way too
Okay, that little place is a great move (Uh)
And ain't no problems unless the water don't stay blue
And the shops there? If they don't got em, they don't make em (True)
No concrete, just sand, throw away your shoes
Now that we are on our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late (Come on)
Everything's okay, so I guess I'll catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask (Tell me, oh)

Set a date, sucker, in battle, we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall
Crack is back, y'all – naw
It ain't went nowhere, like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport, who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise

Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish – look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm cuming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat, like Aaliyah, then talk
""Back, back, forth, forth""
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock

Uh-huh, come on
You can say I'm plain Jane but it's not the same
I ain't into big names but I like nice things
I watch boxin' matches and the football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress but I love to sing
I like goin' out, takin' walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls 'cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home and curl up next to ya
Though I'm ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm havin' sex with ya

See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do

Every time I see your smile its got me hypnotized

I keep 'em mesmerized, listen to me closely
E-V-E is how a thorough bred supposed to be
Hate the thirsty type, can't even get close to me
That's why I got my own stack, Daddy, how it's supposed to be
I ain't about the game, playin' and gift chasin'
All in frontin' Daddy please, we both big facin'
All the things I want, I got, forget me not
Just from my stance, why you starin' at me? Got you hot

This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby, for I adore

This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that your hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days, I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct

Baby, smile today
'Cause I been imaginin' more ways
I’m gon' love you better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I’m gon' love you better

When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that – God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes, and rings
Instead, I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight, don’t ever let go
I’ma do it real gentle, baby, nice and slow
One more chance, baby, and don’t say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well, it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

Baby, smile today
'Cause I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon' love you better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I’m gon' love you better

Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin', we gon' die together
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin', we gon’ die together

It’s a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games, callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I’m gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward, I’ll never be the same
I’ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time, I’ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothing's gonna tear us apart, promise

Baby, smile today
'Cause I been imaginin’ more ways

Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do

I got this jones forming in my bones (From a man)

Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
Of a corner bar, and it just seemed right so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
But he walked up, and said, ""What'll it be?""
I said, ""The good stuff""

He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said ""You can't find that here""

'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said, ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new T-shirt saying, ""I'm a Grandpa""
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He said, ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says, ""I'm sorry,"" say, ""So am I""
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff","country, Kenny Chesney, modern country, rock, pop"

It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

It was just an old plywood boat

Trying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here  to the twilight
There's a dead end to my left, there's a burning bush to my right

You aren't in sight

Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?

Mothers on the stoop, boys in souped-up coupes on this hot summer night
Between fight and flight, is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right
I roll the window down, feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down, ah
I feel broken down

Do you need me
Like I need you?

Or am I standing still

Or am I standing still

Or am I standing still?

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come

It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say, ""Woe is me"" instead
And there's an aching inside my head

Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet


My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you","country, George Strait, classic country, Traditional Country, male country"

Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today...

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

Raise a little hell, laugh 'till it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start living', that's the next thing on my list

He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly, she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
And they had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy, she said, ""See you later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy, she said, ""See you later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy, she said, ""See you later, boy""

Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm not a real political man

Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, and hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow?
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching?
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers?
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

How he put down the love

A phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpitatin'
Every time he came near (I do!!)
He got a spankin' new Range
For that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin'
He was plaided
And his hair was cornrowed
He had his wrists bling-blingin'
And his long legs was bowed

But I knew he had me at go

I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
I do!!","rnb, pop, female vocalists, where are they now, USA"
