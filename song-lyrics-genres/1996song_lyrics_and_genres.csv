Sorry I've never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Together)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in Heaven)

Darling, I never showed you (No, no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (Always there)
I thought you'd always be there
I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared (Yeah, and I know)

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way (Lost along the way)
And I know eventually we'll be together (Oh, no, I know)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in Heaven)

(Although the sun will never shine the same again)
(I'll always look to a brighter day) Yeah, yeah
Lord, I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day (One sweet day)
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Yes, we will)

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice whеn I couldn't speak
You were my еyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
Ooh, baby

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me (Loved me), oh

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark, shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies, you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (Oh, when I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach (Oh)
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me (Hey)
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach (Oh)

Yeah, wish I told her how I felt
Maybe she'd be here right now
But instead...

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say
The things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly
But you're nowhere around

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know
I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me
Said when the nights are lonely...

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me","rnb, soul, 90s, american, male vocalists"

When judgment comes for you (When judgment comes for you)
Now tell me what'cha gonna do (Now tell me what...) When there ain't no where to hide
When judgment comes for you (Cause it's gonna come for you)

Now feel it, the pain was gettin' me hypеd and so violent
But Wally was the worst of us all
Pump in his chest and hе never knew it
Poor Wally had to fall victim, a casualty
But I lay my soul down and I think it all better when it falls down
Everybody got problems to face to face everyday
With it when there's so many lost souls (Lost souls)

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven follow the Lord all 24
7 days, God is who we praise even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keepin' me safe and in my place, say grace
And maybe you people should do to the same (The game)
Recognize a good game man, it's an everyday thang how we gotta maintain

Now follow me roll stroll whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone on their rest;
Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
It's steadily creepin' up on the family
Exactly how many days we got lasting?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away

Little Eazy's long gone, really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go bye bye, all a little thug could do was cry, cry
Why they kill my dog? Damn man, I miss my Uncle Charles ya'll
And he shouldn't be gone, in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong (Ooh wrong, ooh wrong...)

We choose the way you gonna go into the coffin man
When it comes to Judgement Day
Flame and blaze, and up at The Door
With all of my problems man
What a thankful day
Through the pain I still maintain
Bang! Put it on my grave

See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely

Hey my niggas, you know that we care
And cough up weed wit a me peoples
 and I believe 'em
Rest In Peace, son
When I hit the hater hater, where will I go? This world has been so cruel
And runnin' up when they're hittin 'em strong, Bone

I still feel for you even though your long gone (Wally, Wally)
You always got love from Bone
Eternally, gotta love Little E for lovin' me and my peoples B.O.N.E
Yeah, you put that Bone Thugs on now

What's up with murder yall? See my little cousin was hung, somebody was really wrong
Everybody want to test us dog
And Miss Sleazy set up Eazy to fall
You know we be sinnin' and Krayzie intended on endin' it when it ends
Murder come again, again and again
Now tell me whatcha gonna do?

And now that they see that the world goes round and round and round
Now I'm startin' to see why somedays I was lonely
But it ain't that the world don't love me
But it's like that when I gotta make the money
Faithful, livin' in a hateful world, it's all about our family and how we grow
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives til eternal our soul

Yeah, and here we roll, cold, with the Thug N Harmony
Lil' punk in the trunk
Set 'em up with the murder
Eazy E died, he gone, and now Bone and Mo! seekin' revenge on this song
Soon to take him head on and he's drunk
Midnight fell, that gotta be wrong

And I'm thuggin' off at the golden gate safely

And past your door

Now you've disappeared somewhere

We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me

And I miss you

Back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hanging around your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on

And I miss you

It's the good advice that you just didn't take

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down
He thought, ""Well, isn't this nice?""

And then meeting his beautiful wife

That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that

That it's all coming back to me

And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever (Forever)
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this

And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Get tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

And now we're grown-up orphans that never knew their names
We don't belong to no one, that's a shame
You could hide beside me, maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
And did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?

You grew up way too fast, and now there's nothing to believe
Then reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

And I won't tell 'em your name
Hmm, mm-hmm
And I won't tell 'em your name
Oh!

But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are, come back down

People livin' their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
He says, ""Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls""
Says, ""Come here boys, there ain't nothing for free""
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put him in your will, but

Who will save your souls when it comes to the flowers now?
Who, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
La dee-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da-da, da-la-da

We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss 'em
And the cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war
Another tower went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different Gods as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin, but

Who will save your soul when it comes to the babies now?
Who, who will save your soul after all those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
La dee-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da-da, da-la-da

Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill
Got social security but it doesn't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil, but you're okay for today, say
That you love them, take their money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

Who will save-ave your soul when it comes to the babies?
Oh, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save-ave your souls if you won't save your own?","female vocalists, pop, folk, singer-songwriter, rock"

Must have been mid afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out
And he walked with a purpose in his sneakers down the street
He had many questions, like children often do

He said, ""Tell me all your thoughts on God
Tell me am I very far?""

Must have been late afternoon
On our way, the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars, skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions, like children often do

We said, ""Tell me all your thoughts on God""
'Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me, am I very far, am I very far now?

How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained, we pass many cross-eyed people
And ask many questions, like children often do

Tell me all your thoughts on God

32,33,"""Gangsta's Paradise""",Coolio featuring L.V.,"1 ContributorRap Critic Reviews: “Gangsta’s Paradise” by Coolio ft. L.V. LyricsHi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:
*show ODB with hair*
You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:
""Fantastic Voyage""
Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood
Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by
And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned
*video starts*
You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:
""You wanna tell me what this is all about""

Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint

*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down
Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success
Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!
This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…
Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool. I didn't feel like he enjoyed any of this. I felt like he hated this lifestyle, he hated himself, and he hated the world that put him here. This song is a lament, it is a dark evaluation of what was going on in the heart of Hiphop, and it was needed in pop culture, and… hey, this song was also parodied by Weird Al… I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose...","rap, Hip-Hop, 90s, hip hop, West Coast Rap"

And keep it on the down low

What is a man to do in a situation like this?
I feel there is something that I, I don't wanna miss

And keep it on the down low

Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Coming by my way driving his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together

And keep it on the down low

This is some of the lingua franca of the funk business
And people come from miles around
With  an almost religious devotion to get on down

One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta-gotta get up to get down
Gotta-gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta-gotta get up to get down

What up everybody, so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention
Now I wants to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C-
Double O-L-I-O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know
One, two, three, it's like A, B, C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

One, two, three, four

Gotta-gotta get up to get down
Gotta-gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta-gotta get up to get down

If you got beef, then nigga, eat a pork chop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I break like anti-locks, panties drop
From hood to hood, block to block
Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby, you can do it, take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night
My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a jheri curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on, now what'cha gonna do, so
Grab your partner, do-si-do
Now if you don't know who it is, it's Coolio
Slide, slide, but that's the past

But don't step on my toes 'cause you might get smushed

And what I say I bend a co'ner on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope he don't trip 'cause I don't want to have to gat 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homies crazy
The way you shake that ass, it always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'Cause a west coast party don't stop

Then you gotta give the nigga his props
I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean

We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Hung down with the freaks and ghouls

Last night, you were so into it
You told me secrets that, you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and, yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine, as you taste mine
I kissed your lips, you felt my body slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night (Last night)
I was inside of you (Inside of you)
Last night (Last night)
While making love to you (While making love to you)
I saw the sun (The sun), the moon (The moon), the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and, so very innocent
We talked of memories, our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night, right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight, in your soul
You felt incredible, I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night (Last night)

The sight of you, I fall apart

I feel like I've been blown apart, there are pieces here

And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it

And even though you know I love you
I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth
When I kiss your salty lips, you will feel a little crazy

Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock

Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting throwed like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother, James, things changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick (Trick), and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone! (Yeah)
Yeah
Like this, East Point and we gone

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from (""Ayy"")
Some nigga was saying something
Talking 'bout smoke something
""Hey, man, you remember me from school?"" ""No, not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I'd been going through the same things that he has
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job, it's your resolve that breaks

Because the Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hook brings you back
On that you can rely

There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact, I don't mean any of this
Still, my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue, I'll refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow

Was that the hook that brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely


Suck it in, suck it in, suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin to see what you're doing to me
This MTV is not for free
It's so P.C., it's killing me
So, desperately, I sing to thee of love
Sure, but also of rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried -- well, no, in fact, I lied
Could be financial suicide, but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide, I'll do as I'll decide
And let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute ditties
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all of your cities to the ground
I've found I will not mess around
Unless I play, then hey, I will go on all day
Hear what I say, I have a prayer to pray
That's really all this was
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
I don't rely on luck because

The hook brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie

In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partners
At the Hotel Flamingo, wearin' black market shoes
This loud Cuban band is crucifyin' John Lennon
No one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sing the blues

She's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulder
Christ, what's she doin' with him, she could be dancin' with me
She stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant finger
I wanna be what she's drinkin', yeah, I just want to be

I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart?
Everyone was looking
But I saw you first

On a moon-spattered road in her parrot rebozo
Gypsy Scotty's driving his big long yellow car
She flies like a bird over his shoulder
She whispers in his ear, ""Boy, you are my star""

But I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
Yes, I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart?
Everyone was looking

In the bone-colored dawn, me and Gypsy Scotty are singin' (Yeah)
The radio is playin', she left her shoes out in the back
He tells me a story about some girl he knows in Kentucky
He just made that story up, there ain't no girl like that

But I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
Yes, I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart?
Everyone was looking
But I saw you first
I saw you first

A long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
We went searchin'
Through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down
Real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well, who hasn't been there before?
I come 'round
Around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

Well, okay, I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

Far away from here

It felt like springtime
On this February morning
In a courtyard
Birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said
To make me feel all right
I carry them with me today now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why
I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy-hearted
'Til you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I want to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy
I wonder why (ooh la kah koh)

B-boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for your ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Whose body? Your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boot
Now let me take sight to you loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

Keep on, keep keepin' on

Your love's so brand new
Keep on keep keepin' on

Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
A-yes, I can, can, why not
If I wanna, yes, I can, can
More honey than a bumblebee hive
Pulling sixty-nine ways out my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got the shit to make your ass write a bad check
'Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Ven aqui and I'll get rid of all company

Keep on, keep keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love's so brand new
Keep on keep keepin' on
Doin' it right, right, right

Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ringin', ringin' my bell
You're playing with my time, tryna jerk me
Hurt me then desert me, you better work me
While you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info of my sheets in the street
'Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boot on a video shoot
But it's all good though, you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame, get the name and kick the game

Excuse me
There we go

I've seen the world, been to many places
Made lots of friends, many different races
I've had such fun around the world it's true
African skies with a Nairobi mood
I fell asleep in Tuscany and dreamed
The one thing missing was you

Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines
Oh, under the moon glow, down in Mexico
I dreamed, one thing was missing that's you

Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

We'll sail the waters of many colors
Won't need no compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
I want to share the world with you, you see
Springtime in Paris feels so good to me
Oh, this is for me reality, so please
Make all my wishes come true

Runaway with me, my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah
And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah

And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah

Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sipping Seagram, chewing on a weed stem
Touching on my fo' fif'
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this po' pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three-line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And, plus, we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
'Cause I forgot where I met the ho
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the ho, really doe
To the crib (P-O P-I-M-P)

Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow

Get involved in the backseat

Pity cries on my strategy side, yo anatomy gotta be right
That'd be to flatter me, right
But if the head the bomb, c'mon, suck a nigga dick
Members of my clique wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try that, to the rhythm of a hi-hat

While she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your ho
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me, trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another B, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room, she rubbing me with lotion
Coming like an ocean, coasting, have her sick

The word no was never said

And if I ever leave whoever dead

After words I'ma slay a crew

Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn

Sittin on a quarter P of hay, thangs is feelin good today
I'm tore up, from the floor up, sippin on some Crown Royal
Trippin, in a circle of wood where everybody smoke they own bud
Good ole' hay, how you feel today? Fine, blowed and dandy
Silly like I'm hype off candy, gotta big, thick chick named sandy
In the farm in the middle of the barn where everybody's feelin crazy
I went to visit granny's house, now I see why don't nobody leave
We constantly, constantly, constantly smokin B's
Too blitzed to even shake it off, but I still got my head up
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn and get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut, blaze it up so I can hit that bud
Get me zoned and i'll be on cause I love to smoke upon hay

Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn

The hay got me goin through a stage and I just can't get enough
Smokin everyday, I got some hay and you know I'm finna roll it up
Make a cloud, I'm gonna take my mind away from all the bullcrap
Bump my sounds, lay back and roll, mack to the freaks that's on the road
Sometimes I wonder when I was blowed on the streets
Anybody wanna step to me, I'mma see how rough they be
In this session, manifesting on my P's and Q's, never snooze cause I refuse
Inhale, exhale the smell, smokin hay all by myself
Wildstyle, laughin loud, wit my homies by my side
If somethin jump off let it ride, on my square when time is live
Everybody throw it up, go to the barn and get some hay
When I get my choke on, fool you know I'm smokin on......

Hay now hay, we smokin up hay in the middle of the barn
And I'm lit up, can't get up, my eyes are red and my head is spinnin
Took another pull, ridin red bull, got the goofies, can't stop grinnin
Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids and we bout to get in em
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at and everything funny
Gotta pause some nigga tryna blow my high smokin all that hay with no money
Now truly this bitch wanna do me, so I hit the 151 Bacardi
She high like the sun, thick like cornbread and I'm ready to party
That hay got me so gotdamn horny but I don't like that tramp
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie cause the ho had a book of foodstamps
And I got the munchies, I need soul food, collard greens or pinto beans
If you smoke hay like the conflict do, then you know what the hell I mean

Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn

Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat door crack
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb so creep up on the wall and all I heard
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in the hay with a funky dime word
Couldn't be myself, couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If I didn't pass it to the left, nigga would have lost my breath
Open up the window 'fore I fall and faint but I can't cause I roll around in dat barn ride
Rollin up the hootie hoo, roughest skin roller on dat west side
Nigga come on in, I got some hay, won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for? Ain't nobody to rich, we poor
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn, the flies keep us chokin
Thank you Jesus Christ for all the hay you're givin us cause we'll keep on smokin'

94,95,"""Back for Good""",Take That,"26 ContributorsBack for Good Lyrics
I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined I figured out this story (No, no)
It wasn't good (No, no)
But in the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find
(Can't you find)
A little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

I guess now it's time, that you came back for good","pop, british, britpop, 90s, boybands"

Your love is wonderful, yeah
And I don't want to lose you
So baby...

Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

Sleepless nights and lonely days are all that fill my head
All of the time, oh baby
But all I do, is think about the way you make me feel
'Cause baby, this love is so real

Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

If I try to spend some time with you to make you happy
Would you feel better?
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love

Making love all through the night
We could hold each other tight
I can take away the pain
If you would only let me
Just forget about the past
'Cause I want to make it last
Baby, I apologize
'Cause boy, I really need you in my life

Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

Baby, if you give me just another chance (Oh baby)
I can show you love (More love)
Promise I'll be true to you
(You don't ever have to worry)
Don't ever have to worry (No, no, no)
'Cause I'm gonna treat you right
(Baby, I miss you)
Baby, I miss you, just want to kiss you
Hold you in my arms

Soon as I get home
Baby, I know what I gotta do
'Cause I don't need no one but you
Soon as I get home
Baby, I know what I gotta do
'Cause I don't need no one but you
Soon as I get home

You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy, then you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well, there's nothing I can do
I've been lookin' for a girl like you

You look at me, you got nothin' left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance, you won't sing
I just wanna love you, but you wanna wear my ring

Well, there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan, sittin' on a fence
I say that line is great, you ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
She inherit a million bucks and when she died, came to me

I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you


Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder if it will ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy, then you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the Dolphins make me cry

Well, there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you

99,100,"""Don't Cry""",Seal,"8 ContributorsDon’t Cry Lyrics
Don't be so hard on yourself
Those tears are for someone else
I hear your voice on the phone
I hear you feel so alone
My baby
Oh, my baby
Please, my baby
My baby

When we were young
And truth was paramount
We were older then
And we lived our life without any doubt
Those memories
They seem so long ago
What's become of them?
When you feel like me, I want you to know

Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby

Today I dreamed
Of friends I had before
And I wonder why
The ones who care don't call anymore
My feelings hurt
But you know I overcome the pain
And I'm stronger now
There can't be a fire unless there's a flame

Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby

Limousines and sycophants
Don't leave me now, cause I'm afraid
What you've done to me
Is now the wolf in my bed
In my head
In my head
In my head

The challenges, we took were hard enough
They get harder now
Even when we think that we've had enough
Don't feel alone
Cause it's I you understand
I'm your sedative
Take a piece of me whenever you can

Don't cry, you're not alone (Don't be so hard on yourself)
Don't cry tonight, my baby (These tears are for someone else)
Don't cry, you'll always be loved (I hear your voice on the phone)
Don't cry tonight, my baby (I hear you feel so alone)
(I hear your voice on the phone)
(Tonight sweet baby)
(I hear you feel, so alone)

My baby
Don't cry tonight
You'll still be loved","soul, pop, singer-songwriter, 90s, rock"
