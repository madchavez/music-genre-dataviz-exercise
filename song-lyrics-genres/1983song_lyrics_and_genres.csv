She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey

Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Moved a million hearts in mono

Sang along, who'd blame them?

You don't know if he cries at night
You don't know if he don't

You don't know how he feels

Where angels fear to tread

Some men go slow
Some men go just where they want
Some men never go

Comfort in the crowd

And she wonders where she is
And it's strange to her

Nine A.M. on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
Just waitin' for her clientèle

And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there
It's a sacrifice, working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
To hear them say that they care

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She already knows
She's seen her bad times
She already knows
These are the good times
She'll never sell out

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on to ""Used to be""
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our lives, out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know, where the clear wind blows

Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive, today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know, where the clear winds blow
Love lift us up where we belong

With parts made in Japan (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
I am the Modren Man
I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain IBM
So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised
I'm just a man who needed someone and somewhere to hide
To keep me alive, just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive

I'm not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see
I've come to help you with your problems, so we can be free
I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior, forget what you know
I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control
Beyond my control, we all need control
I need control, we all need control

If it seems a little time is needed
Decisions to be made
The good advice of friends unheeded
The best of plans mislaid
Just looking for a new direction
In an old familiar way
The forming of a new connection
To study or to play

Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

Stories to be told
And plain to see the facts are changing
No meaning left to hold

And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned

I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see

Why should we worry?
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars now, so far away

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay?

Deep in my soul
I feel so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching after today

So there it is, girl
We've got it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say?

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?

I know it's late and I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely, both of us lonely

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?

Well, we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem, they're killing time
Filling out forms, standing in line
Well, our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance, danced with them slow

And we're living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

Well, we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard, if we behaved
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke, chromium steel

And we're waiting here in Allentown
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face

Well, I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today


And it's getting very hard to stay

Listen boy I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made

She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Oh, listen boy I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul

You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly
When you love someone, you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it, every day before you leave
Pay her some attention, give her something to believe

Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

Listen boy it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes

She's a trusting soul, she's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do

Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

Tell her about it, tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it, the girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it, tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it, before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it

When shadows fall, I pass a small café where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight

Oh, how can I forget you, girl

And I will never be free

Just come back to the places where we used to go, and I'll be there

The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top""

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be all right
Perhaps it's just imagination

And day after day, it reappears
And night after night, my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

And day after day, it reappears
And night after night, my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day

I made a break, I run out yesterday
Tried to find my mountain hideaway
Maybe next year, maybe no go
I know you're watching me

I've seen the signs
And the looks and the pictures
That give your game away, yeah

With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way?
Do you feel the same?
'Cause you don't let it show

People stare and cross the road from me
And jungle drums
They all clear the way for me
Can you read my mind?
Can you see in the snow?
And fiery demons all dance
When you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me
You're about as easy as a nuclear war
There's a dream that strings the road

How can I blame you

The hope that one day we'd be so much

They put a parking lot on a piece of land

On the site that used to be the local Palais
That's where the big bands used to come and play

All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing?

Another Saturday, another date
She would be ready but she'd always make them wait

He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek

Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did

My sister should have come in at midnight
And my mum would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate

The day they knocked down the Palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the Palais
Part of my childhood died, just died

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the Palais used to stand
My sister's married and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would

You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing, but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around?

And I get to the morning, then you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain, when will we meet again?

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end, not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you, love
Tell me when do we try?
Or should we say goodbye?

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you, oh

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by

And the strangled cries of lawyers in love?

To the mating calls of lawyers in love

Well, there's a little boy waiting
At the counter of the corner shop
He's been waiting down there, waiting half the day
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground
He gets to his feet and he says

What about me? It isn't fair
I've had enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

Well, there's a pretty girl serving
At the counter of the corner shop
She's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream
Her dreams walk in and out; they never stop
Well she's not too proud, to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams

What about me? It isn't fair
I've had enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

Take a step back and see the little people
They might be young
But they're the ones that make the big people big
So listen as they whisper:
""What about me?""

And now I'm standing on the corner
All the world's gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone

But sometimes I wish for more, than I've got

And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you
All of my life

It's you, it's you
I've been waiting for all of my life
Maybe it's you (It's you), maybe it's you (It's you)
I've been waiting for all of my life
Maybe it's you (It's you), maybe it's you
I've been waiting for all of my life (It's you, it's you)
Maybe it's you (It's you), maybe it's you
I've been waiting for all of my life","classic rock, pop, 70s, adult contemporary, 80s"

Tonight, I celebrate my love for you
It seems the natural thing to do
Tonight, no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you

Tonight, I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too
Tonight, our spirits will be climbing
To a sky lit up with diamonds
When I make love to you, tonight

Tonight, I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through
Tonight, there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you, tonight

Tonight, I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new
Tonight, we will both discover
How friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight, I celebrate my love for you
And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through
Tonight, there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you

Tonight, I celebrate my love for you

You better watch what you say
You better watch what you do to me
Don't get carried away
Girl, if you can do better than me

Go
Yeah, go
But remember

Good love is hard to find

You put a hand on my cheek
And then you turned your eyes away
If you don't feel complete
If I don't take you all of the way

Then go
Yeah, go
But remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe

Hard times you had before you
I knew when I first saw you
You girl you've always been mistreated, cheated
So leave it all behind you
It took so long to find you
I know that we can last forever, ever and more, oh, oh

Don't cry now that I've found you
Don't cry take a look around you
Don't cry it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry

I knew I'd never doubt it
I was so sure about it
Don't think of all that's been before
I'll hear you when you're calling
I'll catch you when you're falling
Don't worry I will always be there

Don't you feel like trying something new?
Don't you feel like breaking out or breaking us in two?
You don't do the things that I do
You want to do things I can't do
Always something breaking us in two

You and I could never live alone
But don't you feel like breaking out just one day on your own?
Why does what I'm saying hurt you?
I didn't say that we were through
Always something breaking us in two

They say two hearts should beat as one for us
We'll fight it out to see it through
I say that won't be too much fun for us
Though it's oh so nice to get advice
It's oh so hard to do

Could we be much closer if we tried?
We could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes
Maybe we could last an hour
Maybe then we'd see right through
Always something breaking us in two


They say two hearts should beat as one for us
We'll fight it out to see it through
I say that won't be too much fun for us
Though it's oh so nice to get advice
It's oh so hard to do

Could we be much closer if we tried?
We could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes
Maybe we could last an hour
Maybe then we'd see right through
Always something breaking us in two

Always something breaking us in two","new wave, singer-songwriter, pop, 80s, rock"

I can tell you that love is too deep to be played on, haha
