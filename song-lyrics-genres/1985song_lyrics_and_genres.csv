Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find
Should have known better, yeah


Oh, woah, woah, oh
Mm

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to chеat a friend
And waste the chancе that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend (Shoulda known better, yeah)
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Never without your love


Tonight, the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh


(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?","pop, 80s, new wave, british, dance"

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running 'round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that, alone, I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling; that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, mmm, make a wrong one right
Power of love'd keep you home at night

You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might, mmm, make you mad
But you'll be glad, baby, when you've found
That's the power, makes the world go 'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden, it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you'll know what to do (You'll know what to do)
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You'll feel the power of love
Feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmm, hmm


It don't take money and don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train

Everybody's saying silly things
Without knowing that life brings a change
And they've been checking all the signs
My friends say I'm lovesick 'cause I

All I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Got to see what love is all about)
And I won't be the same until she is mine
And my friends keep telling me to

Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooh, watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down
You're gonna fall in love

Every day I walk her home from school
And she tells me, how she really feels
And there's no doubt in my mind
That this girl is one of a kind

'Cause all I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Understand you're one of a kind)
And I won't feel the same until she is mine
And my friends keep telling me to

And I'll never be the same until you are mine
And my friends keep telling me

When you got a girl who takes her time
You must slow the pace, you can't mess with her mind
If she feels the same, she'll let ya know
Just prepare yourself or be ready to go
And I hope this message stays in your mind
'Cause you almost lost a girl who is right on time
There's one more thing that you got to know
Just cool it down and stay in control!

Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooh, watch out
You're gonna lose control

You better slow it down
Slow it down

And I'll never be the same until you are mine, oh
Listen to me, let me tell you

Why you all coming down on me?
Tryin' to tell me how my life is supposed to be
I know you're only trying to help me out
Tryin' to show me what life is really about
But this time I'm gonna make it on my own
So why don't you fellas just leave me alone

You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up and the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room and down on the street
Moving through the crowd in the midnight heat
The traffic roars, the sirens scream
You look at the faces, it's just like a dream

Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves, it's in your blood

When you said goodbye, you were on the run
Trying to get away from the things you've done
Now you're back again, and you're feeling strange

Many times, I cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone

To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?
Do we distort the facts?
Now, there's no looking forward
Now, there's no turning back

Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song, his heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds, and I still can hear him say
""Aw talk to me, so you can see, what's going on""
Say you will sing your songs forevermore

Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift

You came and gifted us, your love it lifted us higher and higher
Keep it up and we'll be there at your side

We're not scared to lose it all, security thrown through the wall
Future dreams we have to realise
A thousand sceptic hands won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

Treating today as though it was the last, the final show
Get to 60 and feel no regret
It may take a little time, a lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away

Just a little more time is all we're asking for
'Cause just a little more time could open closing doors
Just a little uncertainty can bring you down

And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender

With a little perseverance
You can get things done
Without the blind adherence
That has conquered some

And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender

And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light

You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait

Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

All change—don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue?
It's Iceland—or the Philippines—or Hastings—or—
Or this place!

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city
What do you mean?
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town—
Tea girls, warm and sweet (Warm, sweet)
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me


Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha
And thank God I'm only watching the game—controlling it—
I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you'd better go back to your bars, your temples
Your massage parlours—

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me","new wave, pop, 80s, british, male vocalists"

Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children, the last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

Looking for something we can rely on
There's got to be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

So what do we do with our lives?
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark?

No place to be ending but somewhere to start

Tell me it will be just the way it was, oh

Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the lands I'd known
I recognized the fields where I'd once played
Had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire","rock, pop, classic rock, british, singer-songwriter"

Penny lover, don't walk on by
Penny lover, don't you make me cry
Can't you see, girl, who my heart's beating for?
You're the only girl that I adore

The first time I saw you
Oh, you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine
Honey, you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl, a love like yours is hard to resist, oh

Penny lover, my love's on fire
Penny lover, you're my one desire
Tell me, baby, could this be true?
That I could need someone like I need you?

Nights warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl, I surrender
What more can I do?
I've spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl, I'll do anything, just please stay, oh

I don't understand it, oh, what's come over me?
But I'm not gonna worry, no, not anymore
'Cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
With a love like yours, it's hard to resist, oh
(I'm gonna say this again)

Penny lover, don't you walk on by (Don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (Don't you make me cry, baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (Don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (Oh, penny baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (Don't you walk on by)

I remember the first time I saw you baby
Penny lover, don't you make me cry
You had the look in your eye, you had the look in your eye, yeah, yeah
Ooh, pretty baby
I just wanted to reach out and touch you, baby
I wanna reach out and hold you, I wanna reach out and say ooh
Woah, oh no, now
Don't make me cry
I wanna talk about you every day (Penny lover)
Need you, baby (Ooh), need you, baby
Oh, penny (Penny lover, ooh)
Oh, penny baby
Can't you see I need you, baby? (Penny lover, ooh)
Don't you walk on by, ooh (Penny lover, ooh)
Can't you see that I need you, baby?
My penny (Penny lover, ooh)
Don't you walk on by, oh, oh, penny
My baby
Don't you walk on by","soul, pop, 80s, rnb, motown"
96,97,"""All She Wants to Do Is Dance""",Don Henley,"18 ContributorsAll She Wants to Do Is Dance Lyrics
They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail
The local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance

Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, ""Don't come back here, Yankee""
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money
'Cause all she wants to do is dance

And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

And make romance
All she wants to do is dance","classic rock, rock, 80s, singer-songwriter, soft rock"

What'cha doin' out there
Who you tryin' to be
I know what you're thinking
'Cause I've been there myself
I've been kicked so many times
I don't know nothin' else
Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the flair
That ya got from chasin'
All those east coast dares
And I've seen it before
It happens time and again
All cut up inside
Yet you're caught in a spin
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Saw you dancin' out at Madame Wong Two's
You did the same two steps
That I taught you back in June
Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Café
Did you get your fill
Did you think you had to pay

Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the pain
And I'm sure it's the same
You feel again and again
And I wish I could get us
That second chance
But you're having too much fun
With your sudden romance
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Oh' take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Saw you walking out on Sentimental Street
What'cha doin' out there
Who you tryin' to be

My sugar walls
My sugar walls

Where I come from, there's a place called Heaven
That's the place where all the good children go
The houses are of silver, the streets are gold
But there's more where you come from, my sugar walls

My sugar walls (Ooh)
My sugar walls

Blood races to your private spots
Lets me know there's a fire
You can't fight passion when passion is hot
Temperatures rise inside my sugar walls

Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls

Take advantage, it's all right

I feel so alive when I'm with you
Come and feel my presence
It's raining tonight
Heaven on Earth inside my sugar walls

Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls

I can tell you want me (My sugar walls)
It's impossible to hide
Your body's on fire, admit it
Come inside (My sugar walls)

Ahh (My sugar walls), ooh
Come inside (My sugar walls), my sugar walls
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (My sugar walls)
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls
