There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine

Eu tenho uma mente suja, eu tenho um jeito podre
Eu estou tentando banhar meu primata na sua Via Láctea
Eu sou uma lenda, eu sou irreverente, eu serei reverendo
Eu estarei tão longe, acima, acima, acima, acima
Nós não damos a mínima, uh, oh
Bem-vindo à zona de perigo, entre na fantasia
Agora você está convidado para o outro lado da sanidade
Eles me chamam de alienígena, um astronauta egocêntrico
Talvez seja porque o seu garoto, Yeezy, arranja mulheres fácil

Você é tão hipnotizante, poderia ser o diabo?
Poderia ser um anjo? Seu toque, magnetizante
Parece que estou flutuando
Você faz meu corpo irradiar
Eles dizem: Tenha medo
Você não é como os outros
Amante futurista
DNA diferente
Eles não te entendem

Você é de um outro mundo
Uma outra dimensão
Você abre meus olhos
E eu estou pronta para ir, me guia para a luz

Beije-me, be-be-beije-me
Infecte-me com seu amor
Me preencha com o seu veneno
Leve-me, le-le-leve-me
Quero ser sua vítima
Pronta para abdução
Garoto, você é um alienígena
Seu toque é de outro mundo
É sobrenatural, extraterrestre

Você é tão supersônico
Quero sentir seus poderes
Me atordoe com seus lasers
Seu beijo é cósmico
Cada movimento é mágico

Você é de um outro mundo
Uma dimensão diferente
Você abre meus olhos
E eu estou pronta para ir, me guie para a luz

Beije-me, be-be-beije-me
Infecte-me com seu amor
Me preencha com o seu veneno
Leve-me, le-le-leve-me
Quero ser sua vítima
Pronta para abdução
Garoto, você é um alienígena
Seu toque é de outro mundo
É sobrenatural, extraterrestre

Eu conheço um bar em Marte
Onde eles dirigem naves espaciais ao invés de carros
Roube um traje espacial da Prada sobre estrelas
Ficando estupidamente bêbado, direto das jarras
Bolsos rasgados, foguetes no convés
Diga-me o que vem a seguir, sexo alienígena?
Eu vou despir você, depois vou te penetrar
Veja, eu te abduzi, então eu te digo o que fazer
Eu te digo o que fazer, o que fazer, o que fazer

Beije-me, be-be-beije-me
Infecte-me com seu amor
Me preencha com o seu veneno
Leve-me, le-le-leve-me
Quero ser sua vítima
Pronta para abdução

Não estou trabalhando duro?
É, certo, fotografe isso com uma Kodak
E melhor ainda, vá à Times Square
Tire uma foto minha com uma Kodak
Tire a minha vida do negativo ao positivo
E eu só quero que todos vocês saibam
Que à noite, vamos curtir a vida
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo!
À noite eu quero tudo de você, à noite
Me dê tudo à noite
Para todos sabermos que podemos não alcançar o amanhã
Vamos fazer isso à noite
(Não se importe com o que eles dizem
Todos os jogos que eles jogam, nada é suficiente
Até que eles mexam com o amor), vamos fazer isso à noite
(Eu quero você à noite, eu quero que você fique
Eu quero você à noite)
Pegue alguém sexy e diga-a, me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite, me dê tudo à noite, me dê tudo à noite

Ocupe-se à noite porque cada vez mais faço o mal antes a Prius
Desesperado à noite, posso te fazer minha rainha
E fazer amor com você infinitamente
Isso é insano
A maneira como o nome cresce, o dinheiro se mantém fluindo
Os trabalhadores se movem para o lado
Então estou na ponta dos pés, mantenha fluindo
Fiquei trancado como a Lindsay Lohan
Coloque isso na minha vida, querida
Posso fazer te sentir bem, querida
Não posso prometer o amanhã mas prometo a noite
Dale
Me perdoe
Mas eu posso beber um pouco mais do que deveria, à noite
E eu posso te levar pra casa comigo se eu puder, à noite
E querida, eu posso te fazer sentir tão bem à noite

Me dê tudo à noite
Para todos sabermos que podemos não alcançar o amanhã
Vamos fazer isso à noite
(Não se importe com o que eles dizem
Todos os jogos que eles jogam, nada é suficiente
Até que eles mexam com o amor)
Vamos fazer isso à noite, (eu quero você à noite
Eu quero que você fique, eu quero você à noite)

Pegue alguém sexy e diga-o, me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite, me dê tudo à noite, me dê tudo à noite
Alcance as estrelas
E se você pegá-las, pelo menos você está no topo do mundo
Pense nisso
Porque se você escorregar, eu irei cair em cima de você, garota
Coloque bolas quando eles dormirem no Macy's
E não há segredo
Minha avó é de Cuba, mas sou americano
Amarrado sobre o dinheiro, como Seacrest
Coloque isso na minha vida, querida
Posso fazer você se sentir bem, querida
Não posso prometer o amanhã mas prometo a noite
Dale
Me perdoe
Mas eu talvez beba um pouco mais do que deveria, à noite
E eu posso te levar pra casa comigo se eu puder, à noite
E querida, eu posso te fazer sentir tão bem à noite
Porque nós podemos não alcançar o amanhã
À noite eu quero tudo de você, à noite, me dê tudo à noite
Para todos sabermos que podemos não alcançar o amanhã

There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar

Barbies on the barbecue

I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

But this Friday night

Ripped my favorite party dress

Think I need a ginger ale

Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I'm still around

Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, and it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time

But now you're grown up, so fly, it's like a blessin'
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions

Just as much as you admire bartendin' and strippin', baby

One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit

No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home

It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

La-la-la, whatever
La-la-la, it doesn't matter
La-la-la, oh, well, la-la-la

We're goin' at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world, tonight, tonight
And we're dancin' on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it
But watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis, huh?

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
'Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster 'cause he couldn't cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
'Cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz and
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it 'cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What's it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain't
Some bullshit; people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, 'cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I'm 6'8""

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this, I'll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin'
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oww, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see

Send me away with the words of a love song

She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand

Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out

There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt

(I get 'em up!) I'm on one
(I get 'em up!) Fuck it, I'm 'on one
(I get 'em up!) I said I’m on one

J'ai trop bu... Ce n'était pas aussi difficile lorsque j'avais dix-huit ans
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like ""what's up with your best friend?
On pourrait tous bien s'amuser, crois-moi
Et quoi de neuf avec ces nouveaux négros ?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
Mais refléchis un instant ici, garçon
Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot with a little more cash
Than I already got trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long and my fans who been so patients
Moi et “40” de retour au travail, mais toujours cette odeur de vacances
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
Je sens juste que le trône est vacant, regarde-moi le prendre !

Tout ce qui m'importe, c'est l'argent et la ville d'où je viens
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
L'argent doit être pris, et moi je vais prendre cette merde
Cause I’m on one, I said, fuck it, I’m on one

Je fume des fleurs violettes, ça brûle ma poitrine
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
On marche sur les nuages, suspendus dans les airs
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Arme à la ceinture, je propulse les minots aux sommets (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Appeler Marc Jacob personnellement pour commander une paire
Donc ouais, on plane, la vie est injuste (Khaled)
Et c'est MMG jusqu'à ce que je passe à la chaise

Tout ce qui m'importe, c'est l'argent et la ville d'où je viens

Tu sais que les fédéraux écoutent, négro quel argent ?
J'ai réussi, je dois faire quelque chose
Your niggas on the bench like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Oh, j'suis sur le point de devenir Andre The Giant
You're a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches #Mazel Tov
It’s a slim chance I fall #Olive Oyl

Ağlımı itirmək üzrəyəm
Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Bütün dünyaya söylədim, bir gün borcumu geri ödəcəyəm
Bunu kasetdə saxladım, bir gün kaseti yenidən oxuda bilim
Amma bunu söyləyərkən mən belə inanmırdım
Şübhə getdikcə yaxınlaşır
Hər günüm ya qara, ya da boz
Ümid, mənə sadəcə bir zərrəsi lazım
Çünki, kimsə mənim gördüyümü görmür
Musiqimlə söyləməyə çalışdığımda bərbad deyirlər
Onlar mükəmməlin nə olduğunu bilmirlər
Bunu yazarkən ayıq olub-olmadığımı belə bilmirəm
Tək bildiyim şey bu pis günlərimdə yanımda olmağının zərurəti
Mənə dayaq oldun, yeni bir həyat verdin
Bütün bunları sənə borcluyam
Amma niyə mənim gördüyüm kimi görə bilmədiyini anlamıram
Bu içimdən gəldi, sən oğlunu itirdin
İblislər səninlə vuruşur, hər yer qaranlıq
İzn ver işıqları yandırıb hər yeri aydınladım və nə olduğunu görməyinə şərait yaradım
Mənim üçün nə ifadə etdiyini bildiyini sanmıram, həm də heç
Çünki, səninlə mən bir komanda kimi idik, sənin köməkçin idim
Bu lənətə gəlmiş mikrofonu buraxdıqda mənimlə savaşmaq istəyəcəksən
Ya da məni qucaqlayacaqsan, amma seçimlərim çox az
Edə biləcəyim bir şey yoxdur, çünki..


Ağlımı itirmək üzrəyəm
Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Sənin çırpındığını gördükcə üzülürəm; mənə yeni fikirlərlə gəlirsən
""Onlar sadəcə piyada"" deyirsən, başa düşmürəm
Çünki, eşitdiklərim çox mənasız
Amma ya getdikcə tənbəlləşirsən
Ya da artıq özünə inancın qalmadı
Öz fikirlərini belə canlandıra bilmirsən, elə görünür
Qərar verə bilmirsən, özünü günahlandırırsan
Və hardasa mənim köməyim üçün yalvarırsan da
Sanki mən sənin liderinəmmiş kimi, mənim ağıl müəllimim olmalı idin
Artıq dayana bilmirəm, kim olduğunu xatırla
Mənə inanan sən idin
Halbuki hər kəs məni götürməməli olduğunu söylərkən
Şirkətindəki hər kəs, gəl həqiqətlərdən danışaq
Kariyeranı mənim üçün riskə atan sən idin, bunu ikimiz də bilirik
Kimsə ağ birisi ilə əlləşmək istəmədi
Dre, bu kabinetdə ağlayıram
Həyatımı xilas etdin, indi isə xilas etməsi sırası məndə
Amma sənə əsla borcumu ödəyə bilmərəm, etdiklərin hər şeydən önəmli
Amma inanmaqdan əl çəkmirəm, sən də məndən
Oyan Dre, ölürəm, sənə ehtiyacım var, Tanrı xatirinə geri dön!

Ağlımı itirmək üzrəyəm
Uzun zamandır yoxsan
Zamanım tükənir
Mənə bir həkim lazım, mənə bir həkim çağırın
Mənə bir həkim lazım, məni həyata geri gətirməsi üçün

Ciddən bir ömür öncəymiş kimi hiss edirəm
Yenə də xatırlayıram sanki dünən baş verib
Sarı paltarınla gəldin, içəridəki hər kəs lağa qoydu
Sən studioya girənə kimi, mikfrofonu öldür demişdim
Dostlarım oldu, bəziləriylə yola getdik
Amma hamısı getdi, ölənə kimi dost qalacağımızı söyləmişdilər
Bəs indi hansı cəhənnəmdədirlər?
Tam onlara ehtiyacım varkən heç birini görə bilmirəm; tək gördüyüm Slim
Hamınız rədd olun! Yalnız ona ehtiyacım var
Lənətə gəlmiş xainlər
Çətin vəziyyətə düşdüyümüzdə sadəcə izləyib güldünüz
İndi isə Aftermath'ın qəzəbini görəcəksiniz, ibnələr!
Bizi yalnızca işləyərkən görəcəksiniz
Və ""Harada idiniz"" deyə soruşacaqsınız

Denn du kannst es nicht leugnen, du hast mich umgehauen
Wenn ich dich sehe, Baby, will ich einfach nicht loslassen

Ich hasse es dich weinen zu sehen, dein Lächeln ist eine schöne Lüge
Ich hasse es dich weinen zu sehen, meine Liebe stirbt innerlich

Ich kann all diese Lügen korrigieren

62,63,"""Written in the Stars""",Tinie Tempah featuring Eric Turner,"60 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschWritten in the Stars Lyrics‘Written in the Stars’ means something is intended to happen or meant to be.
Tinie Tempah wrote this song, which can be found on the “Disc Overy” album, about his passion for and struggle to get his name known.
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main, (oh)
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way (Let's go!)

Yeah, you're listenin' now
They say they ain't heard nothin' like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man, I'm like a young gun, fully black Barack
I cried teardrops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racquet and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I'm bringin' gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?), Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screamin' 'til they hear you out

Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh (Yeah)
Seasons come and go, but I will never change (Won't change)
And I'm on my way

Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)

Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped
Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh (Yeah)
Seasons come and go, but I will never change (Won't change)
And I'm on my way

Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)

Oh, written in the stars

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets

A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song

Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought it
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)

Tell her I apologize, happened over time

""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings

And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that

I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain’t who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you

There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!

Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention, but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that whine 'n' dine
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off

I like my girl face south and her ass north

We were sitting up there on your momma's roof
Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said, ""Say I do""
I did and you did too
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?


Yeah baby I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?","country, rock, country rock, alternative rock, Awesome song"

Waiting for that sun to go down

Hellbent on getting high
High above the lights of town

One is one too many, one more is never enough

Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins

She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane

He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby

No matter where I am
