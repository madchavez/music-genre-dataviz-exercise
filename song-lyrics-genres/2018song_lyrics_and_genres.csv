I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect

Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (the coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)

Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten, but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up,"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D.​
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Brand-new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
Twenty-five hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the eighties
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man, I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em go crazy

König von New York, sucht nach der Königin
Ah, du hast die Richtige
L-Lass es diese-l-lass es diese S-S-Schlampen wissen, Nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, prr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

Muschi ist nass, nass, und es tropft, tropft
Ist eine Spritzpistole, fick sie, sie ist ein Fefe
Ihr Name Keke, sie bläst meinen Schwanz als sei er gratis, gratis
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich das getan?“
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich sie gefickt?“
Ich weiß nur, dass ich sie nicht zu meiner Frau machen kann
Bin nett zu ihr, damit sie sich nicht wehrt
Drehe um und fick es von hinten, hinten, hinten
Beuge sie runter und lass es klatschen, klatschen, klatschen

Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde, nein

Draco hat den Rückstoß, wenn ich schieße, werden sie zu Leichtathleten
Sie schießen nicht zurück, ein Schuss, Nahdistanz, roter Punkt
Kopf platzt, ja, ich hab's getan, ja, das ist mein Leben
Rufe einen Uber mit meinen Schützen, mit einem Ruger, wir erledigen dich
Typen sagen, sie töten Leute, doch ich tu' es wirklich

Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde, nein

Er-Er will 69 wie Tekashi, nenn' ihn Papi
Shoutout an A$AP, halte mich mit Diamanten bestückt, ich komme aus New York, also bin ich frech
Sagt, er mag meine Bande, kaufte mir Chloé wie Kardashi
Hält meine Muschi in Versace, sagte ich bin schön so wie Tinashe
Halt-Halte es alles in sein Gesicht, wurde ich angeklagt?
Soeben ist jemand meinem Pussy-Game erlitten, doch ich hinterlasse nie eine Spur
Gesicht so schön, Arsch langt für Tage, ich bekomme Chips, ich frage nach Lay's
Ich lehne mich nur zurück, wenn er fertig ist und frage, „Wie hat es geschmeckt?“
(Yo, wie hat es geschmeckt?)

Ich will nicht wirklich keine Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich keine Freunde, nein

Ey yo, Draco hat den Rückstoß
Wenn es zurückstoßt, bekommst du deine Sachen nicht mehr wieder
Genau genommen bin ich diese Bitch, diese
„Ich hasse Smalltalk, Plaudereinen kümmern mich nicht“
Klimaanlage hat aufgehört zu funktionieren
Also rufen sie mich, sagten mir ich solle mein Handgelenk zurückbringen
Komme hin, Mode tragend
Bringe jede Bitch dazu zu sagen, „Yo, was ist das?“

Ich will nicht wirklich keine Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich keine Freunde, nein

Ene, mene, miste
Die Hure rappelt in der Kiste
Wenn sie nicht mich und Nicki fickt
Kicke ich die Schlampe zurück durch die Tür (TR3YWAY)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Tekrar yeni bir savaşa karşı hazırlıklıyım
Bu yolda ilerlemeye devam edeceğim
Her şey hala aynı
Tekrar yeni canlar almaya daima hazırım
Biliyorsunuz bunu sürdürebilirim
Her şey hala aynı (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Söyle bana, beni kendimden kim koruyabilir
Tüm ömrüm boyunca bunu öğrenmek istedim
Söyle bana, beni cehennemden kim koruyabilir
Sen olmadan, ben tamamen yalnızım

Kim benim için dua edecek?
Kim acılarımı benden alacak?
Kim ruhumu koruyacak?
Gördüğün gibi, yalnızım
Eğer senin için ölürsem
Eğer senin için öldürürsem
O zaman senin için kan dökmüş olacağım,hey

Dünyayle savaşıyorum, seninle savaşıyorum, kendimle savaşıyorum
Tanrıyla savaşıyorum, sadece söyle bana yükünün ne kadarından kurtuldun?
Acıyla ve kasırgalarla savaşıyorum, bugün ağladım
Gözyaşlarımla mücadele ediyorum, kapımın eşiğini su basıyor
Cehennem gibi bir hayat, sokaklarda kandan gölcükler
Nişancılar binaların çatısında, devletin yardımları iç açıcı olmuyor
Deprem, dökülen bedenler, yer yarılıyor
Sigaradan ciğerleri zayıflamış fakir bir koşucu ve Scarface
Kimin bir kahramana ihtiyacı var? (Kahraman)
Senin bir kahramana ihtiyacın var, aynaya bak, haydi kahramanına git
Ground Zero'da ön saflarda bekleyen de kim? (Kahraman)
Zor zamanlarda iğne vursan bile, kalbimin ritmi asla şaşmaz
Kitleler imha ediliyor ve bozuluyor
Ruhlar adama acı çektiriyor
Sağır kulaklarını tekrar tıkıyorsun, mahşer günü geliyor
Bunların hepsi bir kehanet ve eğer büyük bir iyilik için kurban edileceksem
Bu derhal yerine getirilmeli

Kim benim için dua edecek?
Kim acılarımı benden alacak?
Kim ruhumu koruyacak?
Gördüğün gibi, yalnızım
Eğer senin için ölürsem
Eğer senin için öldürürsem
O zaman senin için kan dökmüş olacağım,hey

Took you like a shot

Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you (Feelin' about you)

And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to

You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it

She looks so pretty even without her make up
She try to calm me down everytime I'm getting pissed off
Every chance she'd get, she would try to kiss my lips off
Crazy but I love her, I could never run from her
She's cool like the winter but she hotter than the summer
I might give her another ring as I'm dialing out her number
But it really doesn't matter, as long as we love each other

Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me

Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me

Sometimes, I feel like givin' up

Afraid to be alone again, I hate this

Amor, hablemos de amor
¿Es algo y todo lo que esperabas?
¿O la sensación te atormenta? (Atormenta)
Sé que la sensación te atormenta (Atormenta)

Esta puede ser la noche en que mis sueños me dejen saber que
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Esta puede ser la noche en que mis sueños me dejen saber que
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Todas las estrellas están más cerca

Dime que me vas a hacer
El enfrentamiento no es na' nuevo para mí
Puedes traer una bala, traer una espada, traer un morgue
Pero no puedes traerme la verdad
Al carajo tú y todas tus expectativas
No quiero ni tus felicidades
Reconozco tu falsa confianza
Y promesas calculadas en tu conversación
Odio a la gente que se siente titulada
Mirándome demente porque no te invité
Vaya, ¿Eres importante?
¿Eres la moral de la historia? ¿Estás respaldando?
Pendejo, ni siquiera me gustas
Corrompido el corazón del hombre con un regalo
Así es como descubres con quién estás negociando
Un pequeño porcentaje es con quien estoy construyendo
Quiero el crédito si estoy perdiendo o estoy ganando
Lo juro por mi madre, esa es la mierda más honesta

Amor, hablemos de amor
¿Es algo y todo lo que esperabas?
¿O la sensación te atormenta? (Atormenta)
Sé que la sensación te atormenta (Atormenta)

Esta puede ser la noche en que mis sueños me dejen saber que
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Esta puede ser la noche en que mis sueños me dejen saber que
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Todas las estrellas están más cerca
Todas las estrellas están más cerca

Hace frío cuando un ego se pone a hablar
Me involucro, como un rebote
Sin control, no, estoy cambiado en la forma en que me estás derribando
Es un excitó, no me esperaste
Déjame sola, aléjate de mí
Y suena mal, aléjalo de mí, sí
Solo lloro sin motivo
Solo rezo sin motivo
Solo pienso por la vida, por los días
Por las horas y otra como respirando
Lo hice todo porque se sintió bien
Lo dejarías todo si se sintió mal
Mejor vive tu vida
Nos estábamos quedando sin tiempo

Amor, hablemos de amor
¿Es algo y todo lo que esperabas? (Oh, oh, oh)
¿O la sensación te atormenta? (Atormenta, atormenta, atormenta)
Sé que la sensación te atormenta (Atormenta)

Esta puede ser la noche en que mis sueños me dejen saber que

Me siento como Tyson con eso
Golpéalo dos veces, estoy con eso
Solo por la noche, estoy bromeando
Solo por la vida, sí, solo por la vida, sí
Solo por la vida, sí, consigamoslo
Golpea ese hombro delgado

I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you

'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message

You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though? Trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo

Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed

You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga

Can I stop the flow of time?

Oh, turn the lights, turn the lights down low

Tell me what you want from me, I'll do it if you say so
'Cause you're the only one for me, I'm never gonna say no
I found me an angel, I can see it in your halo
Have you ever dreamt what we could do?
Have you ever sent an ""I love you""?
I've never felt the feelings that I feel for you
So maybe we could make a we of me and you
I'mma treat you right tonight, let's make it last forever
I promise you that no one else will ever treat you better
And if you don't believe me, please see I don't need no effort
All you gotta do is flip that switch before we bed-up

Evet, evet

Küçük bir çocuk olduğum sıralar, aşık oldum
Eskiden bize elele tutşsak o bile yeterdi be oğlum
Sonra biz büyüdük, birbirimize dokunmaya başladık
Okul otobüsünün arkasındaki ışığın dibinde öpüşürdük eskiden
Ah be, baban pek benden hoşlanmazdı
Ve ona senin benim için doğru kişi olduğun söylediğimde bana bir parça bile inanmadı
Ah ama kız her gece pencereden sızıp dışarı çıkmanın yolunu buldu

O bir zamanlar benimle doğu yakasında buluşurdu
Güneşin batmak bilmediği o şehirde
Ve sen de biliyorsun bunu biz her gün
Mavi renkli bir Corvette'la arka sokaklarda dolaşırdık
Bebeğim, biliyorsun sen de bu geceliğine sadece bir yerlere sıvışmak istiyorum
Istediğim her yere gidebiliriz

Sahile doğru süreriz arabayı, atla koltuğa
Yalnızca elimi tut benim ve benle gel, evet
Aklımıza koyduğumuz her şeyi yapabiliriz
Tüm hayatını önüne koy ve sonra bir plan çiz
Benim sevgim senindir eğer sen de onu almaya gönüllüysen tabii
Kalbini bana bahşet zira ben onu kırmayacağım
O zaman gel ve bugünden başlayalım
Farklı bi beldede yeni bir hayata başlayalım
Sevginin bu fikirle ortaya çıktığını ikimizde biliyoruz
Bu yüzdendir ki bebeğim, benle uzaklara gel, gel

17 yaşındaydık ve aile olma hayalimiz vardı
Bir evimiz ve içinde aramızdaki her şeyin olduğu
Ve sonra, ah, bir anda 23 yaşına basıverdik
Şimdilerdeyse hayat denen şeyi daha da ciddiye almak zorunda kaldık
Bizi kariyer sahibi yapmayacak işlerimiz ve ödememiz gereken faturalarımız
Eski dostlarımıza ve tanıdık düşmanlara sahibiz
Küçük bir çocuk olduğum zamana dönüp düşünüyorumda
Aşık olduğum o günleri

O bir zamanlar benimle doğu yakasında buluşurdu
Güneşin batmak bilmediği o şehirde
Ve sen de biliyorsun bunu biz her gün

Creo que serás más feliz, quiero que seas más feliz

Quiero cambiar de mente

Quiero levantar tus ánimos (Levantar tus ánimos)
Quiero verte sonreír pero

Quiero que seas más feliz, quiero que seas más feliz

I spend a lot of nights thinking about you
I don’'t know how or when (Eh, eh)
But I only know that I remembered (Eh, eh)
How I did it to you that time (Oh, oh)
And I can't continue to be alone (Hehe)
But I know that I threw you out
I threw you out of my life, and threw you out (Yeh)

I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go
To hell I sent you … and I sent you
I threw you out of my life, and threw you out
Yeh, yeh, mami

Baby life is a cycle (Wuh)
And if doesn't work, I don't recycle
So move from my life
If I give it to you it’'s to remember a TBT, yeh
I got tired of your liеs
There’'s another girl who likеs me (Yeh)
Everything has its end, everything expires (Yeh)
You’'re the past and the past never returns
Go to hell (Wuh)
My body doesn’'t need you
What it's asking for is a dirty dance in the Placita
I don’'t think our story will repeat
Go ahead, turn on a phillie and leave one ready for now, yeh eh
I hate to know that I trusted in you again
I hate all the ""I Love You's"" that I texted a thousand times
Baby, better than you I have like 10
Our love drove in a Bugatti and you stayed on foot, I threw you out

I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go
To hell you left … and you left
And I nailed your friend, I nailed her
Fuck you, bitch (Wuh)

Baby I threw you out
And ever since I threw you out, the girls come in three's (That's right)
If you don't believe me, just ask (Baby)
That I no longer have stress
To complete the line, they're express
What a mess how your world went backwards
I messed with her
That I fell in love the day I tasted her
I don't think I'm going back and giving it to you
Mami, because I cancelled your service
If I do not answer
The problem is going to hit rock bottom
Mami breathe deeply, while I hide it (That's right)
With you I'm obligated to wear a condom today
But I'm posting in mid-court, baby, like Rondo
I give you a funeral (That's right)
I know that over time the wound heals (By law)
But the truth is that you’'re not at my level
I sweat to God even though you shouldn't swear to God (Ratatata)

Baby I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … I let you go (I cut you slack and I let you go, so you know)
To hell I sent you, eh, eh (Are you understanding what we're trying to say? To hell I sent you)
I got you out of my life, eh, eh

To hell, I threw you out (Woo)
I feel good without you (Ah)
I no longer suffer for love, now I break hearts, and I have lots of $100 rolls ($100 rolls)
You broke my heart (You broke my heart) (Woo)
Without meaning and without reason (Without meaning and without reason) (Ah)
But I have a new ass who gives me a lot of affection and fucks me real good (Real good)
I'm not going to deny that I suffered and had it bad
But I survived and out of my life I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … (I let you go)
And I don't want to know about you
And to hell I sent you … I'm going to go drink today (Going to do drink)

Out of my life, I threw you out
And I know you're not just anybody
I’'ll spend my entire life
Asking where did it go
But your friend texts me
Every time she desires me
She takes a photo with me
And tells me it's for you to see it
I light up to see if I forget
Your name, your kisses, your body, your moans
We would do it in the car, you would scream in my ear
You left far from here without an explanation
You saw my movie and gave me your back
Now you want to know what I think of you
I feel good because you're not here
The same way you came, you can leave (You can leave)
I’'m not going to deny that I suffered and had it bad
But I survived and out of my life I threw you out (I threw you out)
I cut you slack and I let you go … (I let you go)
To hell I sent you …I sent you
I got you out of my life …I got you out
Baby, I threw you out

I'm lying if I tell you that I don't miss it when you would rub your skin on me
I'm lying if I tell you that I don't miss your morning calls
Asking me to give it to you rough in bed and make you my woman
I’'m taking advantage of this remix with Ozu to send you to hell also
I don't want lies or your fakeness
I'm going to the street, to a party tonight
I'll drink two drinks and I'm going to forget you
I'm leaving with the girls who want to play
I don't want lies or your fakeness
I'm going to the street, to a party tonight
I'll drink two drinks and I'm going to forget you
I’m leaving with the girls who want to play

Baby I threw you out …threw you out
I cut you slack and let you go …I let you go
To hell I sent you …I sent you
And got you out of my life …I got you out

The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me, you make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated

We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren

Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will heute einfach sterben
Ich will einfach sterben
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will einfach sterben
Und lass mich dir sagen warum

All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft
Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts
Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen
Ich hatte nie einen Ort, den ich mein Eigen nennen konnte
Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause
Keiner ruft mein Handy an
Wo warst du? Wo bist du? Was geht in dir vor?
Sie sagen jedes Leben ist wertvoll, doch interessiert sich für meins

Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen

Du musst heute nicht sterben
Du musst nicht sterben
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Ich will, dass du lebendig bist
Du musst heute nicht sterben
Jetzt lass mich dir sagen warum

Es ist der erste Atemzug
Wenn dein Kopf im Wasser untergegangen ist
Und die Leichtheit in der Luft
Wenn du da bist
Brust zu Brust mit einem Geliebten
Es ist Weitermachen, auch wenn der Weg lang ist
Und Licht in den dunkelsten Dingen zu sehen
Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst
Endlich zu wissen wer es ist
Ich weiß, dass du Gott danken wirst, dass du es getan hast

Ich weiß wo du warst, wo du bist, wohin du gehst
Ich wieß, dass du der Grund bist, warum ich ans Leben glaube
Was ist der Tag mit einer kleinen Nacht?
Es kann schwer sein
Es kann so schwer sein
Aber du musst jetzt leben
Du musst jetzt alles geben

Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins (Wer kann es verstehen? Wouh)
Ich bin im Tief gewesen, ich hab' mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich, als hab' ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an, als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will heute nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will endlich lebendig sein
Ich will nicht sterben
Ich will nicht sterben

Schmerz tut nicht so weh, ich weiß
Die Spur, die ich fahre, fühlt sich einsam an
Aber ich bewege mich bis meine Beine aufgeben
Und ich sehe meine Tränen im Schnee schmelzen
Aber ich will nicht weinen
Ich will nicht mehr weinen
Ich will mich lebendig fühlen
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben
Oh ich will nicht
Ich will nicht
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben",

That day I saw you and I felt your energy
Since then, I don't want you far from me (Far from me)
I know you don't know about me (About me)
And I can't lie to you
What they say on the street about me (About me)

And I won't deny you
We're clear and that's it (And that's it, and that's it)
I won't deny you (Haha, I can't deny it)
We're clear and that's it (Haha, we're clear, we're clear)

Just let me get you, baby
Thirst-quenching kisses on the neck
My hand on your hip to start, as it is
We ain't never gonna go down no more, mama (No)
Da-da-da-da-dance
Plakata, plakata
As she moves it, nonstop, nonstop
The desire to eat you, now it's stronger
I wanna have you

And I won't deny you (Come over here)
We're clear and that's it
I won't deny you
We're clear and that's it

What I've seen from you, Mommy, is not normal (Normal)
But don't worry that I'm abnormal (-normal)
I know your friends must not like me, eh
But go on and tell them, part by part
How we have sex and I take the stress off you
Let's do it again

I'ma take it to trial
Pray to Lord I beat the case

That money be callin'
I don't do no talkin'
So get the fuck outta my face
Got a TEC and a chopper
With a hundred thousand dollars up in the Wraith
You know I ain't slippin'
You know that I'm with it
I'll shoot him right up in his face
3Three say that I'm trippin'
You know that I'm drippin'
I'm wrapped in Saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from God
I ain't put it on yet
I don't care 'bout no bitch
I ain't givin' her shit
Spend it all on my homies
I can put on my son, from my car to my house
Everything, I own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stuntin'
I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin', you know I won't fight him
My clip full of thunder, you know that I'll strike 'em
Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body
Free Kevin Gates, it's a murder for hire
Double G gang on the front of my title
Got rid of my Glock and I bought me a rifle

Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinkin' on Act' today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

I jump out at your house
I ain't shootin' from the corner
Been bought me a bitch but I really don't want her
I don't do no cappin', I keep it one hunnid
Right now I'm recordin' with ten thousand on me
He say he want smoke but I know he don't want it
Shoot him and his bitch and I up on his homie
You know how I'm feelin'
I don't got to say it
Face every problem all by my lonely

Wind up home alone

Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second things second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh

The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down like

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer","indie, indie rock, alternative, rock, indie pop"
