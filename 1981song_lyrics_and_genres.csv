Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on you
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you
When she snows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you

Each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes

There's no other love like our love
And yes
Oh yes, I'll always want you near me

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time

But when I see you darlin'
It's like we both are fallin' in love again
It'll be just like startin' over (Over)

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy?
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by, my love

Why don't we take off alone?
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again

Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know, I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm

They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

Working nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'

It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, yeah, they got you where they want you

And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet

But hide your heart beneath the covers and tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm goin' through
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun

Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture

Just have your party on TV

Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space

A woman needs a love just like you do, hoo
Don't kid yourself into thinkin' that she don't
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin' she wants

Don't the mistake of thinkin' old fashioned
Times have changed from yesterday
But no longer will those old double standards
Be accepted by the women of today
So when you think you're foolin' her
She just might be foolin' you
Remember if you can do it
She can too

Because a woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinking that she don't
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin' she wants

When her eyes are beggin' for affection
Don't put her off, don't make her wait
Don't try to give her that worn out excuse
About being tired and workin' late
I tell you one day you'll come home
Early from work
Open up the door
And get your feelings hurt

Because she needs it, yeah (Just like you do)
A woman's got to have it, whoa, yeah, just like you
And if you're smart, mmm, (Just like you do)
You better stop foolin' around, hey, hey
Cause she will too, oh

Just like you do, hoo
Thinking that she don't, hoo, ooh
Just like you, hoo
Now an example to you

Is by the time poor Jack
Returned up the hill
Somebody else
Had been lovin' Jill

A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinkin' that she don't
She can fool around (Yeah), she will fool around so
You better take out some insurance and be sure she won't
Give her the love, mmm (Just like you do), yeah
That sweet, sweet love, she wants it just like you
'Cause she can fool around (Just like you do) just like she will fool around (Hoo)
With you or without you, just like you do

A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinking that she don't, hoo, ooh

Seeing what you wanted to see

I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms, thinkin' I belonged there
I figured it made sense building me a fence
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (Yes, it's plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)

But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always stayin' low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise if it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

Well, then what are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?

What are we doin' in love?

We'll probably have our share of fights
We're like roses and switches
It's gonna be hard but we've got to try

So what are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
And what are we gonna tell all our friends?

You don't have to like someone to love someone
That rule was made to be broken
But if we have to say goodbye to a life we've gotten used to
What are we doin' in love then?

We're like sun up and sun down
People say we're never gonna last
Like uptown and downtown
You like it slow, but I like it fast

What are we doin' in love?
What are we doin' in a mess like this?
What are we doin' in love?
What are we gonna tell all our friends?

So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth the love they save

Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you

Don't you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And don't you wonder how
You keep on moving?
One more day, your way
Oh, your way

When there's no one left to leave you
Even you don't quite believe you
That's when nothing can deceive you

While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you

Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

And that old grey wind is blowing
And there's nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going

While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you

While you see a chance, take it
Find romance

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park, I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight, there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic

Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve
She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there, lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged
Went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

She said she'd married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie
I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes, I wasn't sure if I
Saw doubt or gratitude

She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another ""auld lang syne""

The beer was empty, and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away
Just for a moment, I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain","singer-songwriter, soft rock, folk, classic rock, folk rock"

One day I was on the ground
When I needed a hand
And it couldn't be found
I was so far down
That I couldn't get up
You know and
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head
Lost before I'd begun

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
What I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turned around
Fate must have woke her
Because lady luck she was
Waiting outside the door

I'm winning
I'm winning

And I don't intend on losing again

Too bad it belonged to me
It was the wrong time
And I meant to be
It took a long time
And I knew for now
I can see the day
That I breathe for
Friends agree, there's a need
To play the game
And to win again

As far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab
All wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes
And told him about her
I've got to find her

We dreamers have our ways
Of facing rainy days
And somehow we survive
We keep the feelings warm
Protect them from the storm
Until our time arrives

Then one day the sun appears
And we come shining through those lonely years

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it through the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through

When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid
Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade

'Cause when I chased my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it through the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected

Got rained on too

Somehow I'll have to make them just understand
I got it well in hand and oh how I have planned
I'm spreading love, there is no need to fear
And I just feel so good, every time I hear

I'm coming out, I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm coming out, I want the world to know
Got to let it show

I'm coming out, I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out, I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out, I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out, I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out, I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out, I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm, I'm coming out
I have to shout that I'm coming out
I want the world to know, got to let it show
I'm coming, I'm coming out","soul, Disco, pop, female vocalists, motown"

Guess you got me in your spell
But I think that I'll be allright
Even if I don't get well....
Hey, Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....
I can still remember
What you told me with your eyes
One kiss
Now it's down to this
Guess it's time you realize
Hey, Miss Sun, what could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon
Got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms
Has you back in my arms.....
Hey, Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning
Has you back in my arms
In my arms..... ooh.... ooh.... ah.... ah....ahh
Yeah..... yeah, yeah ,yeah

Hey , Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in my way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....
One kiss is what I need.....
One kiss.... give it to me......
It won't be long until the morning has you......
Won't be long until the morning has you back in my arms......
One kiss....I realize
One kiss....I can see it in your eyes
Oh, it won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms.....","soft rock, classic rock, adult contemporary, rock, blues"
99,100,"""Time Is Time""",Andy Gibb,"2 ContributorsTime Is Time LyricsTime it goes on waits for nobody special
In the prime of my life I'll remember you
Living and breathing and some misbelieving
But I can't hold you woman, no piece of you
You were the magic , my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right
Time it goes on waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistaking
But I'll follow you woman , eternally
You were the magic , my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right , all right

Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love
Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right
Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right
Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right
Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right","Disco, pop, 70s, classic rock, australian"
