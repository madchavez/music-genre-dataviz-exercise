Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong

'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, again

Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Chinese checkers by the trees

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
(You know it's hard, you know it gets so hard)

Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)

You know that its crazy and you don't wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone

Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is I've been fooled before
By fair-weathered friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
(Keep lookin' for lies, baby keep lookin' for eyes)

Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends-you better lookout)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, oh it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
(Keep lookin' for lies, baby keep lookin' for eyes)","classic rock, 70s, soft rock, rock, oldies"

It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You're teasing like you do

The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire

Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings

And if you should fall
Remember you almost had it all
Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found
There was nothing left but sawdust and some glitter
But Baby can't be broken, 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher, that was me

A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well, they'd be singing so happily
Oh, joyfully, oh, playfully watching me
But then they sent me away to teach me how to be sensible
Logical, oh, responsible, practical
And then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Oh, clinical, oh, intellectual, cynical

There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am

I said, watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
A liberal, oh, fanatical, criminal
Oh, won't you sign up your name? We'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable

But at night, when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright

Since you took me in

Sweet lies don't give me no rise

Livin' on your cheatin' and the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever, but you're driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I'll win, I'll never give in

Too many lovers in one lifetime ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you when your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I am the man who
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
Figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever, we won't ever feel the storm

Loves you inside and out

Don't try to tell me it's all over

And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle, I will burn again tomorrow
No man on Earth can stand between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me, I will love you till I die

Loves you inside and out

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run

Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin', he turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words, I found an ace that I could keep

Look around you, look up here
Take time to make time, make time to be there
Look around, be a part
Feel for the winter, but don't have a cold heart

And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you

A long time ago, I had a lady to love
She made me think of things I never thought of
Now she's gone and I'm on my own
A love song has come into my mind
A love song, it was there all the time

So lady, let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor making me want you somehow
Oh, lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do

Look around, come to me
I have no answers, but know where I wanna be
I look around, play a part
I was born in the winter and cooled by a warm heart

And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you

There's a smile upon my face
You touch my heart with gladness
Wiped away all of my sadness

It's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I wanna stay

Wanna thank you for the joy youve brought me

The place was so boring, filled with out-of-towners touring

At a guy who stuck out in the crowd

And a face that would make any man proud

While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says, ""How was your night?""
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows, maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
Then she says to wake her up when I am through
God, her love is true

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully

The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
And he was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said ""Boy, let me tell you what""

""I guess you didn't know it, but I am a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle o' gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you""
The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this


When the Devil finished, Johnny said
""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

""Fire on the Mountain,"" run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no


The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been""

Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling, I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die

(You alone)
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow (tomorrow)
If I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
(Only my love)
Only my love can raise you high above it all

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love


We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die

(Happy room)
This happy room would be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulder for the crying on
(No other love)
No other woman's love could be as true
I'm begging you

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see

Got a thing for you and I can't let it go

But they may never find what they dream of

In my world, only you
Make me do for love what I would not do

Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river, you stop
And you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain
To hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they're blowing that sound

Way on down south
Way on down south, London town
You check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind
If he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job
He's doing alright
He can play the honky-tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night

With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
Yeah

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll

And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
“Goodnight, now it's time to go home”
Then he makes it fast with one more thing

We are the Sultans of Swing”","classic rock, rock, 80s, blues, guitar"

But there is no easy way around it

Tell me, is it worth just another try?

And stop him in the nick of time

And give the boy something to dream on later

Shaking it down the hall

She's got a purse that was made in Mexico (Mexico)
A mind that was made for love
She's got a new way of dancing slow
She knows what you're thinking of

I don't care if you never come home
I don't mind if you just keep on
Rowing away on a distant sea
Because I don't love you and you don't love me

You cause a commotion when you come to town
You give them a smile and they melt

Oh, and I don't care how you get your delights
I will leave you alone, I will just let it be

I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end?

La la, la la la la la

You refuse to take me for real

Caught on that wheel of romance
Put on your dancin’ shoes (put on your dancin’ shoes)
Sweep her away with you
Put on your dancin’ shoes
Sweep her away with you, you, oh you
Put on your dancin’ shoes (put on your dancin’ shoes)
Oh, oh, oh","pop, 70s, Disco, west coast, All"

Fancy me
Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be a run
I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Folly and fun
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right (so right)
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
So sure (I was so sure)
But love taught me
Who was, who was, who was the boss

I'd defy
Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control
Whatever moved in my soul
I could tempt
Touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right (so right)
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
So sure (I was so sure)
But love taught me
Who was, who was, who was the boss

Love taught me
Taught me
Taught me
Taught me

I was so right (so right)
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
So sure (I was so sure)
But love taught me
Who was, who was, who was the boss
(Taught me who was, who was the boss)","soul, Disco, pop, female vocalists, motown"

Sail on down the line
'Bout a half a mile or so
And I don't really wanna know
Where you're going
Maybe once or twice, you see
Time after time I tried not to
To hold on to what we got
But now you're going

And I don't mind
About the things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name
Yeah, yeah

Yes, I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time

Sail on down the line
Ain't it funny how the time can go
All my friends say they told me so
But it doesn't matter
It was plain to see that
A small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinking

I gave you my heart
And I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time
Yeah

I gave you my heart
And I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah

I got nothing else to lose
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time
Yeah

Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, sugar
Good times never felt so good

Sail on
Sail on

Didn't I hear you cry this morning?
Didn't I feel you weep?
Teardrops flowin' down on me
Like rivers in my sleep
In my dream of laughter
You came creepin' with your fears
Tellin' me your sorrow
In the tracings of your tears

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me, no
Don't cry to me, no

Didn't I hear your voice this morning?
Didn't you call my name?
I heard you whisper softly
But the words were never plain
And in your dream of darkness
I came shinin' like the sun
Waiting for the laughter
But the laughter never comes

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me, no
Don't cry to me, no

Didn't you feel alone this morning?
Didn't you need a friend?
And in your darkest hour
You came runnin' back again

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me, no
Don't cry to me
Don't cry to me
Don't cry to me
Don't cry to me, yeah

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
