You got me looking at that heaven in your eyes
I was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you
When the words are said, baby, I lose my head

And in a world of people, there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right, uh-huh
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

All that I need is just one moment in your arms
I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you
Make it shine, make it rain, baby I know my way

I need that sweet sensation of living in your love
I can't breathe when you're away, it pulls me down
You are the question and the answer am I
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor

So many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone
To sing me his song
So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, ""Hey, I love you,""
Never again
To be all alone

Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
And tryin' to forget you is just a waste of time

Baby, come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you

All day long, I'm wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby, come back, oh, baby, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you, oh

Now that I put it all together, oh-oh
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me? Ain't there nothing left for me?

Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

Should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise

But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm living for

Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter


Say, my thought
Should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow

But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for

Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream

Some things are better left unsaid

I'll walk the streets at night

Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well, another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people, but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now


Way down the street, there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up, it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'

You ask me if I love you and I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie

And who am I to judge you on what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning to see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you 'til the fear in me subsides

Romance and all its strategy leaves me battlin' with my pride
But through the insecurity some tenderness survives

I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you 'til the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

At times I understand you, and I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you, and I've watched love pass you by

At times I think we're drifters, still searchin' for a friend
A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much

I didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon
Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience
The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were, well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance
You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey, what do you see in me?

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

You're an essay in glamour
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team, I've ever seen
And there have been, many affairs
Many times I've, thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
Cause you're the warmest thing, I've ever found

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend

All your life you've waited
For love to come and stay
And now that I have found you
You must not slip away
I know it's hard believing
The words you've heard before
But darlin', you must trust them
Just once more

'Cause baby, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again
If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't be long away
'Cause the things you do, my goodbye girl, will bring me back to you

I know you've been taken
Afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me
Instead of giving in
But I can wait forever
A helping you to see
That I was meant for you
And you for me

So remember, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again
Though we may be so far apart you still will have my heart
So forget your past, my goodbye girl
'Cause now you're home at last","male vocalists, Sentimental, 70s pop, gentle, melancholia"

I know a man
He came from my hometown
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said, ""Delores, I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear""

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away

The more you're slip slidin' away

And I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said, ""A good day
Ain't got no rain""
She said, ""A bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been""

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again

The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

Set an open course for the Virgin Sea
'Cause I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me

On board I'm the captain
So climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow
On every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord I'll try
To carry on

I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had

We lived happily forever
So the story goes
But somehow we missed out
On the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can
To carry on

A gathering of angels
Appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope
And this is what they said

They said, ""Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away
Come sail away with me, babe

We headed for the skies

And the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be


Oh, that boy of mine by my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away
This hurting inside

I cried a tear
You wiped it dry
I was confused
You cleared my mind
I sold my soul
You bought it back for me
And held me up
And gave me dignity
Somehow, you needed me

You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again
You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me
You needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true!
I needed you
And you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand
When it was cold
When I was lost
You took me home
You gave me hope
When I was at the end
And turned my lies
Back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again

And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

Tell you that it's true
I want to make you understand

Was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more
And the Porter tune (Night and day)
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home
I promised you'd never be alone

Hurry, don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark

After you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it

I have a mansion, forget the price
Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice

I have accountants pay for it all

They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time

I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a limo, ride in the back
I lock the doors in case I'm attacked

I make hit records, my fans they can't wait
They write me letters, tell me I'm great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
Everybody say, ""I'm cool"" (He's cool)
I can't complain, but sometimes I still do

It's hard to leave when you can't find the door

The city streets are empty now
(The lights don't shine no more)
And so the songs are way down low
(Turning, turning, turning)
A sound that flows into my mind
(The echoes of the daylight)
Of everything that is alive
(In my blue world)

I turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone, when you comin' home
I can't go on

The dying embers of the night
(A fire that slowly fades till dawn)
Still glow upon the wall so bright
(Turning, turning, turning)
The tired streets that hide away
(From here to everywhere they go)
Roll past my door into the day
(In my blue world)

I turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone, when you comin' home
I can't go on
Turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone

Yes, I'm turnin' to stone 'cause you ain't comin' home
Why ain't you comin' home if I'm turnin' to stone
You've been gone for so long and I can't carry on
Yes, I'm turnin', I'm turnin', I'm turnin' to stone

The dancing shadows on the wall
(The two-step in the hall)
Are all I see since you've been gone
(Turning, turning, turning)
Through all I sit here and I wait
(I turn to stone, I turn to stone)
You will return again someday

I turn to stone
Turn to stone, when you comin' home
I can't go on
Turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
Because he's not here with me

Hey window pane, do you remember
How sweet it used to be?
When we were together
Everything was so grand, yes it was
But now that we've parted
And there's one sound that I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain

Alone with the pillow
Where his head used to lay, yeah
I know you've got some sweet memories
But like a window, you ain't got nothin' to say

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories, hey
I can't stand the rain, ooh, against my window, no, no
Because he's not here with me, hoo

Well, have you seen that girl in the corner
I'd like to take her out of her chains
'Cause if I had my way with you, baby
I would be changing your life today

Your eyes got me dreaming
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping
That I'll be holding you close tonight
Your eyes got me dreaming
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping
That I'll be holding you close tonight

She was the same as a hundred ladies
But when my eyes looked at her I learned
That she was keeping a secret fire
And if I got real close I'd burn
So it looked like I had to move slowly
Just like a cat at night in the trees
'Cause I was waiting for her to show me
That way that she liked her love to feel

Your eyes got me dreaming
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping
That I'll be holding you close tonight
Your eyes got me dreaming
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping
That I'll be holding you close tonight

I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

There's a lot you can teach me

Does it mean anything to you?

Will take us out to sea

Close your eyes and dream
And you can be with me

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once a story's told
It can't help but grow old
Roses do
Lovers too, so cast
Your seasons to the wind
And hold me, dear
Oh, hold me, dear

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, oh, we're all alone
Close the window, calm the light

She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
He was a Midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
Oh, he was too far from home

She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting, turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills


He'd headed west 'cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
Yeah, he had lost all control

Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights of LA
Wondering if he could ever go home

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
It was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills
In those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills

This is the day of the expanding man
That shape is my shade, there where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers, that's all in the past

You call me a fool, you say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real, I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)

My back to the wall, a victim of laughing chance
This is for me the essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind

I crawl like a viper through these suburban streets
Make love to these women languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide

This is the night of the expanding man
I take one last drag as I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
