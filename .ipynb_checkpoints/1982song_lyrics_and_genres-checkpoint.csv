Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds till we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Risin' up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye
Of the tiger

She was pure like snowflakes no one could ever stain

Wrapped around each other
Trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together
Lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies
Falling in love so desperately

And you were my leading lady

Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know (Ooh, ooh)

We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender
When you gave me your heart
Please say you will
Play it again

We smiled without any style
We kiss altogether wrong
No intention
We lied about each other's drinks
We lived without each other thinking
What anyone would do
Without me and you

Only the lonely can play

So hold on, here we go
Hold on to nothin' we know
I feel so lonely way up here
You mention the time we were together
So long ago, well I don't remember
All I know is that it makes me feel good now

Softly, you whisper

So here I am

An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline—a thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brothers' lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well


I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And, Papa, I don't think I said ""I love you"" near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul

I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know

Still, I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Stay with me, stay

I need you today

Take from me my lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me?
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never wanna leave

Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by

Stay with me, stay

I need you today

Take from me my lace

You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife

Like I wanna talk of you

And California
And anywhere I could run

As we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?

And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying
For unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring

Here, close to our feelings
We touch again, we love again
Remember when we thought our hearts would never mend?
And we're all the better for each other
There's more to love, I know, than making love

Here, no more confusion
We see our lives, we live our lives
Remember when we thought we never would survive?
But now neither one of us is breaking
There's more to love, I know, than making love

Some things never change
Some things sometimes do


And now I'm feeling strong enough to let you in

Maybe that's why you're such a strange and special one
You can't even seem to love yourself
And with a few exceptions, not anybody else
You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink
You can give a man your whole heart and soul
But you cannot make him think
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely
You can tell him the date of departure
Exactly the place and the time
He might really wanna be there
But he misses every time
Is he a man or a paper tiger
When you need him will he run or stand beside you

No, no magic could happen to me
And then I saw you, I couldn't believe it
You took my heart, I couldn't retrieve it
Said to myself, ""What's it all about?""

And when the night, it gets so cold
When I can't sleep again you come to me
I hold you tight, the rain disappears

What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden
Among the flagstones there
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect
Can damage so much grain

And what's it for?
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk
Nothin' grows no more
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed
We're crippled and we're dazed

But no one answers
And I've been knockin'

But he'd have said that roots grow stronger

Here I am
Playin' with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me

Holding you
A feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside

So there's no sense pretending
My heart, it's not mending

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashin' through
And I just can't go on without you

On my own
I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain

I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashin' through
And I just can't go on without
Go on without

From an ocean liner
To a Chinese junk

But pipe dreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never

Couldn't happen to you

You've got a weight on your shoulders

When good love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?

And I see love hungry people tryin' their best to survive
When right there in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive

Don't need a whore, I don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But I'm not waiting on my lady
I'm just waiting on a friend

I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend","classic rock, rock, british, 60s, blues"

When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud

Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?

When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane

Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
Baby

Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love

From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Well, just imagine how it's gonna feel when we hug and kiss

Sugar, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?

'Cause I know the woman for me, you I'll make
And I will not deny myself the chance
Of being part of what feels like the right romance

I should be careful, but I'm goin' deeper instead
'Cause when she looks at me
I wanna run by her side
Anyone could see
A fool could drown in her eyes
And I'm goin' down for the last time
I'm goin' down for the last time
Goin' down, out of my mind
I'm nearly out of my mind
Love is comin' over, over me, yeah
It must be magic how she casts her spell over me
Her secret passion's got me charmed, I'll never get free
'Cause when she's holding me
She lights a fire in my soul
Any fool could see
There's only one place to go
And I'm goin' down for the last time
I'm goin' down for the last time

Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love


When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City

If you get caught between the moon and New York City

I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
Through the years, I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made and I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through the years, through all the good and bad
I know how much we had
I've always been so glad to be with you
Through the years, it's better every day
You've kissed my tears away as long as it's okay
I'll stay with you through the years

Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belong right here with you
Through the years, I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out, I've learned what love's about
By loving you through the years


Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
Through the years, it's better every day

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, baby (Everything stops)
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more (He was no more)
Than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken-hearted
Somethin' within him
But the moment that I first laid eyes on him
All alone on the edge of seventeen

Just like the white-winged dove (Just like the white-winged dove) sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Said, ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Well, I went today
Maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah-yeah
Well, the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
When I see you doin'
What I try to do for me
With the words of a poet
And a voice from a choir
And a melody
And nothin' else mattered

Just like the white-winged dove (Just like the white-winged dove) sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Said, ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes color
But the sea does not change
So with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age-old desire to please
On the edge of seventeen, ooh-ah

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Well, then suddenly
There was no one left standin' in the hall
Yeah-yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
When I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
And not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singin', come away (Come away, come away)

Just like the white-winged dove (Just like the white-winged dove) sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Well, I hear you (Well, I hear you)
In the morning (In the morning)
And I hear you (And I hear you)
At nightfall (At nightfall)
Sometimes to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
