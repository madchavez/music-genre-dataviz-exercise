Love
Love will keep us together
Think of me, babe whenever
Some sweet talking girl comes along
Singing his song
Don't mess around
You just got to be strong

Just stop
'Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together

You
You belong to me now
Ain't gonna set you free now
When those girls start hanging around
Talking me down
Hear with your heart
And you won't hear a sound

Just stop
'Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together

Young and beautiful
Someday your looks will be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turnin' you on
I will, I will, I will
I will, be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I said it before
And I'll say it again
While others pretend
I need you now and I need you then

Just stop
'Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Whatever
Whatever, I will, I will, I will, I will
You better stop
'Cause I really love you
Stop, I've been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Whatever
Whatever, I will, I will, I will

I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain

There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's taking the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone

Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me, you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

Walking home every day, over
Barnegat Bridge and Bay
'Til we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

All my life I will remember
How warm and tender we were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend

The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans

Well, I got a few of my own

Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Mmm, one that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight

Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

Sommers Pictured Below
Well, life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
I thank God I'm a country boy
Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm
A-raisin' me a family and working on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me ole fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play ""Sally Goodin'"" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
I thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me ole fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy, woo


Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money-hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy
Yeah, city folk driving in a black limousine
A lot of sad people thinking that's a-mighty keen
Well, son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me ole fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy


Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, ""Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy""
Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work, to play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me ole fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle

Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

That we could never rise above

But they fought with expert timing

There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up, they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip

In fact, it was a little bit frightening, hey, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung

And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye

So frantically hectic

I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""
And the rich-relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen


To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
They call and say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me

Take a little for myself

Would you dance with me today?

'Til his soul has lost its way

Toward the radio he's bound, never to be found


The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Oh

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Crying in the night

And stopped me from shaking

Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing

My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home, Dad?""
""I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then""

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today
I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
It said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home, Dad?""
""I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home, son?""
""I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then""

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home, son?""
""I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad

She comes down from Yellow Mountain
On a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named Wildfire
With a whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night

Oh, they say she died one winter
When there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down his stall
In a blizzard, she was lost

She ran calling Wildfire
Calling Wildfire
Calling Wildfire

So by the dark of the moon, I planted
But there came an early snow
Been a hoot-owl howling outside my window now
'Bout six nights in a row
She's coming for me, I know
And on Wildfire we're both gonna go

We'll be ridin' Wildfire

Gonna leave sodbustin' behind

Or has time rewritten every line

Could we

Memories, like the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Hahaa...
Oh, can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me.. haha...
Would we
Could we
Memories, may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The Way We Were...
Remember, the way we were",

You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight

But it was you
Who went and bit off
A little bit more
Than he could chew
You said that you had it made
But you been had
The woman no good
No how
Thinking maybe the blood is bad
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The woman was born to lie
Makes promises she can't keep
With the wink of an eye
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Brother, you've been deceived
It's bound to change your mind
About all you believe
From where I stand
It looks mighty strange
How you let a woman like that
Treat you like small change

I don't understand
What you're lookin' to find
The only thing bad blood do
Is mess up a good man's mind
Hear me talkin' now
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Got your lady on the line
Got your name on the cover
Though your friends are ninety-nine
Honey, you ain't got no lover

And you ain't, you ain't, you ain't got no lover
And you ain't, you ain't, you ain't got no other

I remember the feelin' that I could be free-ee-ee
Now I know it could never ever be me-ee-ee
'Cause I'm on fire
Got myself on fire, awhh!

Got your joker on the table
You've been told from time to time
I'll be willin', I'll be able
You could read between the lines

But you ain't, you ain't, you ain't got no lover, lover, lover
And you ain't, you ain't, you ain't got no other

I remember the feelin' that I could be free-ee-ee
Now I know it could never, never be me-ee-ee

She was staring at her coffee cup
He was trying to keep his courage up by applying booze
Talk was small when they talked at all, they both knew what they wanted
There was no need to talk about it
They were old enough to scope it out and keep it loose
She said, you don't look like my type, but I guess you'll do
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
He said, I'll even tell you that I love you, if you want me too
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
When they left the bar, they got in his car and they drove away
He drove to the family inn
She didn't even have to pretend she didn't know what for
Then he went to the desk and made his request while she waited outside
And he came back with the key
And she said, give it to me and I'll unlock the door
She kept saying, I've never really done this kind of thing before, have you
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
And he said, yes I have, but only a time or two

I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way

I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Mmm, ooh, ooh
She looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
""Nothin' yet, you ain't been around""
That's what she told me

And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure

He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothin' yet

You need an education
Got to go to school
