And I never thought I'd feel this way

I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you

To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

For good times and bad times

Well, you came and opened me
And now, there's so much more I see
And so, by the way, I thank you
Oh, and then, for the times when we're apart

Say you, say me
Say it for always

Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand, someone who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got someone there to say, ""I'll show you""

Say you, say me
Say it for always, oh
And that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well, the whole world has got you dancing

Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you, then I realized
That it was just my mind
Playing tricks on me
It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on

Can we really change our minds? But it's our first love

I refuse to believe that you don't care

So many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you
On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married

On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself
No one said it was easy
No

But it once was so easy

Well, I believed in love (I believe)
Now here I stand
I wonder why
Ooh

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
(On my own)
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times
I know I could have told you
Losing you
It cut like a knife
Hey
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you

This wasn't how it was supposed to end

I wish that we could do it all again

I've got to learn to be strong again

I've got to find out what was mine again

And I have faith that I will shine again
By myself
I have faith in me

Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope

Seems our freedom's up against the ropes

Is it East versus West or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire
In the burning heart

In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says ""stop!"", his spirit cries ""never!""
Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide

I often wonder, how it could be
You loving me, two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
Rhapsody plays, a melody for you and me
Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for, the one that I would wait for

You take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep
I always stop and think of you especially

Touch the very heart of me

They can touch the heart of someone new

You turn me on, you lift me up
And like the sweetest cup, I'd share with you
You lift me up, don't you ever stop, I'm here with you

What you gonna do when it all cracks up?
What you gonna do when the love burns down?

What's it gonna take to make a dream survive?
Who's got the touch to calm the storm inside?
Who's gonna save you?

Stay until your love is alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, until your love is alive

Oh, you lift me up to the crucial top, so I can see
Oh, you lead me on till the feelings come
And the lights that shine on
But if that don't mean nothing
Like if someday it should fall through
You'll take me home where the magic's from
And I'll be with you

Spare a little candle, save some light for me
Figures up ahead moving in the trees
White skin in linen, perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over these dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge, shadows where I stand (Shadows where I stand)
I search for the time on a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly, come closer than this (All that I remember)
But all I remember are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away (The further I'm away)

Is it cloak-and-dagger? Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut through a stained-glass wall (Weaker in my eyesight)
Weaker in my eyesight, the candle in my grip (Words that have no form)
And words that have no form are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away (The further I'm away)

There's something out there I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence that I've ever heard (Feet don't touch the earth)
Funny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes, freedom is a kiss (The prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face from dreams in the mist

Too blind to see the writing on the wall

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned

Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you
Baby, so right
I wouldn't be without you, baby, tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
Not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh, and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

That there is something about you (something about the way)

I realize you're seeing someone new
I don't believe she knows you like I do
Your temperamental moody side
The one you always try to hide from me
But I know when you have something on your mind
You've been trying to tell me for the longest time
And before you break my heart in two
There's something I've been trying to say to you

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say, ""I love you""
But the words got in the way

Your heart has always been an open door
But baby, I don't even know you anymore
And despite the fact it's hurting me
I know the time has come to set you free

But the words get in the way

Not a word from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip

All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you...

Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you (Oh, you, all over you, ooh)

Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener, is it too late for me
To find my way home? How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone

Don't you know the hurt will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected

Oh...
I gave you all of me (Gave me all of you)
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
I...
I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all)
Over you (I'm cried out, too)

I said ""Go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay""
I didn't care if you hung around me, I didn't care if you went away
And I know you were never right, I'll admit, I was never wrong
I could never make up my mind, I made it up as I went along

And though I treated you like a child
I'm gonna miss you for the rest of my life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

I never had any time, and I never had any call
But I went out of my way just to hurt you, the one I shouldn't hurt at all
I thought I was being cool, yeah, I thought I was being strong
But it's always the same old story, you never know what you've got 'til it's gone

If I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

How do rumors get started?
They're started by the jealous people
And they get mad seeing something they had
And somebody else is holding
They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
But these wicked women, ooh, they just persist
Maybe you think it's cute, but girl, I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only, with my business
Please don't mess when you

Look at all these rumors
They're surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now
About me and the girl next door

Did you hear that one about Tina?
Some say she's much too loose
That came straight from a guy
Who claims he's tasted her juice
Did you hear that one about Michael?
Some say he must be gay
I tried to argue, but they said if he was straight
He wouldn't move that way
Did you hear that one about Susan?
Some say she's just a tease
In her camisole, she's six feet tall
She'll knock you to your knees when you

Look at all these rumors
They're surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now
About me and the girl next door

I can't go no place without somebody pointing a finger
I can't show my face 'cause when it comes to rumors
I'm a dead ringer, it seems from rumors I just can't get away
I bet there'll even be rumors floating around on Judgment Day
I'll think I'll write my congressman and tell him to pass a bill
For the next time they catch somebody startin' rumors
Shoot to kill when you

Look at all these rumors
They're surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now
About me and the girl next door

I ain't got time for rumors in my life
I'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life
What's mine is mine
I ain't got time for rumors in my life
I'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life (when you)

Wild kind of look to the day
Opening eyes impale neon flickers
She moon, she turning away
The city's her slave, he's cheating his mistress
She's moody and grey, she's mean and she's restless
So restless, so restless indeed

All over you as they say
Rumors or rivals yell at the strike force
Hi guys, by the way
Are you aware you're being illegal?
It's making your savior behavior look evil
'Scuse my timing, but say
How'd you fit in with this flim, flam and Judy?

Maximum big surprise
Your smile is something new

I pull my shirt off and pray
We're sacred and bound to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day

Stretching my love down the way
To your invitation, stretching my body
Use your intuitive play
'Cause maybe we have more playtime than money

She knows something new

I pull my shirt off and pray
I'm saving myself to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray

By roads and backways, a lover's chance downwind
Cut open murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin
Carry further, entangled strands all sing
I'm saving some time to slip away
We could dance!

Shouldn't be asking
Wild and scheming
Could be my election day

Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time

Our bodies felt the morning dew

And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow

And all I knew was you
