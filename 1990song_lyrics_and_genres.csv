I know this pain
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains?
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind, mmm
Is it really fair to feel this way inside? Oh

Someday, somebody's gonna make you wanna
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you gonna let them
Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know, things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

You could sustain
Mmm, or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (No, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess (Ooh)
Lettin' your worries pass you by (Lettin' your worries pass you by)
Don't you think it's worth your time

It must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper
On my pillow
Leave the winter
On the ground
I wake up lonely
This air of silence
In the bedroom

Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
'Til the time had run out

Make believing
We're together
That I'm sheltered
By your heart
But in and outside
I turn to water
Like a teardrop
In your palm

And it's a hard

I dream away

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you


All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares to you

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

From the look upon your face, I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long?
How am I supposed to live without you?
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone?

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree
Don't try to find me
Please, don't you dare
Just live in my memory

All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way

When he saw his own eyes
I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""

She was a Jezebel
Miss Brixton queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream
Telling me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear
Spinning around
Like a wheel on fire
Walking the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you's just like a dream
Love is never what it seems
When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back
But she goes too far
Winding me up just to let me down
So emotional
Gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the formal rising
I was scared
I think I was possesed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly
When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She had an attitude
I can't explain
You never know if you're in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt
Her blood was hot
She burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

One day she'll treat you nice
Then she'll turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her in the end
Think again!

She ain't worth it, girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been putting you through (Ooh)
She ain't worth it, girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know)
I know better than (Better than)
Better than (Bet-bet-better than you)

She gets you hot then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
'Cause she know you'll always give her one, more, try
You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me do you really like standing in line?

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends
She did it again!

She ain't worth it, girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been putting you through (Ooh)
She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know)
I know better than (Better than)
Better than (Bet-bet-better than you)

I'd like to say
She used to be my girl
But that would be a lie (That would be a lie!)
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried (Yo man)

One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I've tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this here as a diss and a goodbye
She ain't worth it even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip, and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry, 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy, but she's nothing but trouble!

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends
She did it again!

She ain't worth it, girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been putting you through (Ooh)
She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it

All alone, silence fills my room

Close my eyes, and I'm there with you

If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
And all the dreams at night of love were real, I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers, not apart
If wishes came true

Now you're gone, and I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams, I still feel your touch
Lying next to me, feeling ecstasy

Take me back, turn back the hands of time

How can I make you understand?
I care about you
So much about you, baby!
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can

'Cause I don't have the heart
To hurt you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I don't have the heart
To love you
Not the way you want me to

You're so trusting
And open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart
Oh, no!
I don't have the heart

I don't have the heart
To hurt you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I don't have the heart
To love you
Not the way that you want me to

I don't have the heart
Ooh!

Outside another yellow moon
Has punched a hole in the night time mist
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
Full of all them Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one you chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
On a downtown train

I know your window and I know its late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way
And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train
On a downtown train

Can't find the joy

And I don't know the reason

Now I'd give anything
To feel the love you bring

They say time can mend a broken heart
And fix you up
But my life could never ever be the same
Without your touch

I know you're still afraid to let me in
And I don't blame you really
I wouldn't let you see me
I took for granted you would always be there

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play

With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no fakin'
Cookin' MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' 'em if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With the ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, wavin' just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on, pursuin' to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm headin' to the next block
The block was dead, yo, so I continued to

Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a 9
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my 9, all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack

They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends

Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade

So fast, other DJs say, “Damn!”

I need her and I want her, so come on to my home

Have you seen her?

At a game, ""A Different World"" or ""The Cosby Show""

Have you seen her?

The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like Houdini, be magic and why don't you appear
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in

Come...

Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago

All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again

To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long

Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

50,51,"""Praying for Time""",George Michael,"19 ContributorsPraying for Time Lyrics
These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find
That what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say, ""What's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much, but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score""
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for?

It's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time","pop, 80s, british, soul, dance"

But I hear the blame was mine

But I wouldn't want to waste your time

All the lonely nights, I spend alone
Never 'round to love me, you're always gone
'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come lookin' for you

(Always carrying on) With the gang
(I'm tryin' to tell you, boy) It's a mistake
(You won't realize) Till it's too late

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong, but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

You're so together, boy, but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep

Alright, stop what you're doin' 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
I look funny, but yo, I'm making money, see
So, yo, world, I hope you're ready for me
Now gather 'round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I'll drink up all the Hennessy you got on your shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with an, ""Umpty""
Yo, ladies, oh, how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten, please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky, I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick with this
Straight gangster mack, but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Ayo, fat girl, come here, are you ticklish?
Yeah, I called you fat, look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly, but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the Hump (Come on, uh)

Do the Humpty Hump (Ha), do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's alright 'cause I get things cookin'
You stare, you glare, you constantly try to compare me
But you can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls, they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
'Cause in a 69, my humpty nose will tickle your rear
My nose is big, uh-uh, I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, you know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I'll shoot an arrow like Cupid
I'll use a word that don't mean nothing like, ""Looptid""
I sang on, ""Doowutchyalike,"" and if you missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'em in the biscuits""
Also told you that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write

Let a little bit of that bass groove right here
Err-rear, der-rit, err-rear, der-rit
Ah, yeah
Now that I told y'all a little bit about myself
Let me tell you a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do, check it out

First I limp to the side like my legs was broken
Shaking and twitching kind of like I was smoking
Crazy, whack, funky
People say, ""You look like MC Hammer on crack, Humpty""
That's alright 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
You got it down when you appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin'
Gig around, shaking your rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stunt
Tell him, ""Step off, I'm doing the Hump""

Ah, yeah
Go on and break it down

And you wait for me patiently
This house is not a home without you, it takes two hearts to share

Your eyes will always see through me and bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you, you're everything I need

We hold each other close, you tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it, never dream of givin' up

Forgive me when I get it wrong, sometimes it's hard to be that strong
And, oh, I would do anything
For you I'd turn the stars around, I'd find a way somehow

This time, you'll see I built a bridge to you again

And through the good and bad times, you have always been there

Girl, well it's been one of those days again
And it seems like the harder I try
Over and over, I'm right back where I began
But you understand
Oh girl, when nothing else in this world goes right
Oh I just want to run to you
You pull me through
Oh baby, who wouldn't want to have you in their life?

Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning?
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?

Times when it was pointless for me to try
I was more than a desperate man
What seemed like forever was gone with one touch of your hand
Oh, girl, if I could count all the sleepless nights
When you were there for me
A fool could see, oh baby
Once that I found you there was no letting go

Tell me, what kind of man would I be?

Woke up to the sound of pourin' rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name

And when you needed me, I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes

So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time, you were there for me

Remember yesterday, walkin' hand in hand

And through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, ""I remember you""

Wished ever after would be like this
You said, ""I love you, babe,"" without a sound


I said I'd give up my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

And through the sleepless nights, through every endless day

Washed away a dream of you
But nothin' else could ever take you away

Call me a joker, call me a fool

This feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight

Is starting to break?

Or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

I would cry myself to sleep and wonder why

Don't wanna put the blame

Than the way they are today
But we forgot the vows we made
And love got lost along the way

Now I can tell just by the way
You look at me that you feel the same

So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone

I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride

The beat and hook come from Freddie Scott’s 1968 tune… Read More 
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on! I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...","Hip-Hop, old school, rap, hip hop, East Coast"

I always love a little mystery
But now the tension's killing me
No place left for words to hide (I'm opening)
I never thought it could be quite so rough
Lips once sealed are splitting up
There ain't no secrets to outshine father time

Whispers in the dark don't do
Let's hit the lights (Baby, hit the lights)
Now I just got to spread the news
(So what are you telling me, what are you telling me
What are you telling me, what are you telling me)

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I don't have any ifs (Oh no)
I am positive
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (Wanna tell the whole world)
We're never gonna be alone (Our love)
Our love is stone (Hey)

Too many words are too much a crowd
I wanna spill 'em or they'll leak out
I'm so glad to get the chance (Whoo! I'm opening up)
I kept it secret till I knew for sure
So not to pick my heart off the floor
Now it's time to take a stand
Heart in hand

Whispers in the dark don't do
Let's hit the lights (Baby, let's hit the lights)
Now I just got to spread the news
(So what are you telling me, what are you telling me
What are you telling me, what are you telling me)

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (Wanna tell the whole world)
When I drop a tear (Oh yeah)
You are always here
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
(I wanna tell the whole world)
I'm looking at a living dream (Don't wake)
Don't wake me up

Don't stop
Love me till you drop
It's alright with me
One sharp arrow through the heart
It's alright, it's alright
Now whistle


I'm gonna tell the whole wide world
I will never give you up
I'm gonna tell the whole wide world
You're my one and only love, huh huh

Whispers in the dark don't do
Let's hit the lights (Baby, let's hit the lights)
Now I just got to spread the news
(So what are you telling me, what are you telling me
What are you telling me, what are you telling me)
(What are you telling me now, girl?)

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (Wanna tell the whole world)
I wanna tell everybody you're my cup of tea (You're my cup...)
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
(I wanna tell the whole wide world)
Your love never shakes (Oh yeah)
You don't alternate (Oh yeah)
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
(I wanna tell the whole world about my love)
Smoke gets in my eyes
I don't see other guys (Yeah)

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (I'll never give you up)
('Cause you are all I ever wanted) Our love will never tumble down
It's built on solid ground
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (I'll never let you go, I'll say it to the world)
I don't have any ifs (It's time I make you mine)
I am positive
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you

Without you, there's no change
Nights and days are gray
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same

Without you, I'd be lost
I slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl, you'd never, never know

Without you, without you
Sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive

But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing, someday,  I'd grow strong

Without you, without you
Sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive

But without you, without you

I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old


Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive

Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Love, if you're there, come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I'll surely die if you're not there

Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

I feel like they're looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple tonight

On your best friend to pull you through""
But even if I wanted to, I couldn't really, truly
'Cause my only friend is you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, come on

There are thieves in the temple tonight

Kicking me in my heart
Tearing me all apart (Tearing me, tearing me)
(Tearing me, tearing me all apart)
'Cause me and you could have been
A work of art (Thieves in the temple)

Baby, don't you know I'm holding on
The best that I can?
Love, please help me be
A better man
Better than the thieves

Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play
When I was little I used to say
I got the X and I got the O
It don't matter when you Tic-Tac-Toe
Now I'm a little bit bolder
I like to play just a little bit older
I like gettin' girls and givin' em pearls
And their legs across my shoulders
I love to go to the disco
See a fly girl and say hello
They just look me in the eye and pass right by
With their booty shakin' like Jell-O
I like to speak cause that's bein' nice
It makes me mad when I have to speak twice
But that's the game that girls like to play
It's just Tic-Tac-Toe and roll the other way

X, and O. It's like yes, and no
Tic-Tac-Toe
X, and O. Is it sex? maybe so
Tic-Tac-Toe

X is for yes and O is for no
X is for sex, O maybe so
You might get some if you play this game
All girls love it but smooth is their name
That's why they just walk right by
Laughin', gigglin', shakin' that pie
Girls are what you what when you come up to them
So don't play 'em dumb and try to school 'em
That's when you boys got to be real cool
Jump in the Benz and act a fool
Pull out the portable car phone
Next thing you know, you'll be drivin' em home
On the way there you're thinkin' 'bout one thing
Girls ain't dumb, they know you want the wild thing
You throw the X and go for the kiss
They throw the O and go for the dis

Now some girls do and some girls don't
Some girls will and some girls won't
Some are rich and some are poor
Some are freaks and some are whores
For the ones that do it get right to it
The ones that fake it make you play it
So when you get one that wants to fake
Take her out to eat and feed her the steak
Just like a dog when she gets a good bone
They think it's money so they follow you home
But that's all right and that's okay
That's what the boys want anyway
Take 'em to the crib, show 'em what you about
That you're a big shot and you got the clout
Put 'em in the den and lay 'em on the couch
Yeah, buddy, it's time to shout

Kind of cute with a real nice booty
Hard to get and likes to play tough
Cause she knows I want the funky stuff
When I spoke, she wouldn't even speak
Til she saw me in the Benz that week
Took her to the movies and bought her a treat
Went to my house and made the bed squeak
Yeah that Judy put up a fight
But I won with the X 'cause I rolled that night
Just when things started to feel good
We rolled a little fast and we broke the wood
My dad got up 'cause he heard some knockin'
Thought it was a crook, me and Judy was rockin'
Came to my room, opened up the door
